ec4693c1-de59-5fc6-9e68-ebe9c1d889c4,Investopedia,SEC,"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Defined, How It Works",,,James ChenThomas BrockVikki Velasquez,"the u.s. securities and exchange commission (sec) is an independent federal government regulatory agency responsible for protecting investors, maintaining fair and orderly functioning ofthe securities markets, and facilitating capital formation. it was created by congress in 1934 as the first federal regulator of the securities markets. the sec promotes full public disclosure, protectsinvestorsagainst fraudulent and manipulative practices in the market, and monitors corporate takeover actions in the united states. it also approves registration statements forbookrunnersamong underwriting firms.
generally,issuesof securities offered in interstate commerce, through the mail or on the internet, must be registered with the sec before they can be sold to investors. financial services firms—such as broker-dealers,advisory firmsand asset managers, as well as their professional representatives—must also register with the sec to conduct business. an example: they would be responsible for approving any formalbitcoin exchange.
the sec's primary function is to oversee organizations and individuals in the securities markets, including securities exchanges, brokerage firms, dealers, investment advisors, and investment funds. through established securities rules and regulations, the sec promotes disclosure and sharing of market-related information, fair dealing, and protection against fraud. it provides investors with access to registration statements, periodic financial reports, and other securities forms through its electronic data-gathering, analysis, and retrieval database, known asedgar.
the securities and exchange commission (sec) was created in 1934 to help restore investor confidence in the wake of the 1929 stock market crash.
the sec is headed by five commissioners who are appointed by the president, one of whom is designated as chair. each commissioner's term lasts five years, but they may serve for an additional 18 months until a replacement is found. the current sec chair isgary gensler, who took office on april 17, 2021. to promote nonpartisanship, the law requires that no more than three of the five commissioners come from the same political party.
the sec consists of five divisions and 23 offices.their goals are to interpret and take enforcement actions on securities laws, issue new rules, provide oversight of securities institutions, and coordinate regulation among different levels of government. the five divisions and their respective roles are:
the sec is allowed to bring only civil actions, either in federal court or before an administrative judge. criminal cases fall under the jurisdiction of law enforcement agencies within the department of justice; however, the sec often works closely with such agencies to provide evidence and assist with court proceedings.
in civil suits, the sec seeks two main sanctions:
the sec also serves as the first level of appeal for actions sought by the securities industry's self-regulatory organizations, such asfinraor thenew york stock exchange.
among all the sec's offices, the office of the whistleblower stands out as one of the most potent means of securities law enforcement. created as a result of thedodd-frankwall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010, the sec'swhistleblowerprogram rewards eligible individuals for sharing original information that leads to successful law enforcement actions with monetary sanctions in excess of $1 million. the individuals can receive 10% to 30% of the total sanctions' proceeds.
when the u.s. stock marketcrashedin october 1929, securities issued by numerous companies became worthless. because many had previously provided false or misleading information, public faith in the integrity of the securities markets plunged. to restore confidence, congress passed the securities act of 1933 and thesecurities exchange act of 1934, which created the sec. the sec's primary tasks were to ensure that companies made truthful statements about their businesses and that brokers, dealers, and exchanges treated investors in an honest and fair manner.
in the years since additional laws have aided the sec in its mission:
today the sec brings numerous civil enforcement actions against firms and individuals that violate securities laws every year. it is involved in every major case of financial misconduct, either directly or in conjunction with the justice department. typical offenses prosecuted by the sec include accounting fraud, the dissemination of misleading or false information, andinsider trading.
after thegreat recessionof 2008, the sec was instrumental in prosecuting the financial institutions that caused the crisis and returning billions of dollars to investors. in total, it charged 204 entities or individuals and collected close to $4 billion in penalties, disgorgement, and other monetary relief. goldman sachs, for example, paid $550 million, the largest penalty ever for a wall street firm and the second-largest in sec history, exceeded only by the $750 million paid byworldcom.
still, many observers have criticized the sec for not doing enough to help prosecute the brokers and senior managers who were involved in the crisis, almost all of whom were never found guilty of significant wrongdoing. so far, only one wall street executive has been jailed for crimes related to the crisis. the rest either settled for a monetary penalty or accepted administrative punishments.
a new sec rule starts with a concept release, which leads to a proposal. both a concept release and subsequent proposal are published for public review and comment. the sec considers the public’s input on the proposal as it determines its next steps.the sec will then convene to consider input from the public as well as industry or other subject-matter experts are considered. they then vote to adopt the rule.
no. the sec is a government organization that sets rules and regulations regarding the issuance, marketing, and trading of securities. the sec is also charged with protecting investors.finra(formerly nasd) is a non-profit self-regulatory industry organization that oversees broker-dealers and issues licenses to securities professionals.
the sec is an independent federal agency that is headed by a bipartisan five-member commission, comprised of the chairman and four commissioners who are appointed by the president and confirmed by the u.s. senate.the sec is accountable to congress as it operates under the authority of federal laws including the securities act of 1933, the securities exchange act of 1934, the investment company act of 1940, the investment advisers act of 1940, and the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 (sarbanes-oxley act), among others.

e7ad9308-0bbe-54e5-9ef6-871bffc713af,Investopedia,Trading Basic Education,Understanding Liquidity and How to Measure It,,,Adam HayesGordon ScottYarilet Perez,"liquidity refers to the efficiency or ease with which anassetorsecuritycan be converted into ready cash without affecting itsmarket price. the most liquid asset of all is cash itself.
in other words, liquidity describes the degree to which an asset can be quickly bought or sold in the market at a price reflecting its intrinsic value.cashis universally considered the mostliquid assetbecause it can most quickly and easily be converted into other assets. tangible assets, such as real estate, fine art, and collectibles, are all relatively illiquid. other financial assets, ranging from equities to partnership units, fall at various places on the liquidity spectrum.
for example, if a person wants a $1,000 refrigerator, cash is the asset that can most easily be used to obtain it. if that person has no cash but a rare book collection that has been appraised at $1,000, they are unlikely to find someone willing to trade them the refrigerator for their collection. instead, they will have to sell the collection and use the cash to purchase the refrigerator. that may be fine if the person can wait for months or years to make the purchase, but it could present a problem if the person only had a few days. they may have to sell the books at a discount, instead of waiting for a buyer who was willing to pay the full value. rare books are an example of an illiquid asset.
there are two main measures of liquidity: market liquidity and accounting liquidity.
market liquidity refers to the extent to which amarket, such as a country's stock market or a city's real estate market, allows assets to be bought and sold at stable, transparent prices. in the example above, the market for refrigerators in exchange for rare books is so illiquid that, for all intents and purposes, it does not exist.
the stock market, on the other hand, is characterized by higher market liquidity. if an exchange has a high volume of trade that is not dominated by selling, the price a buyer offers per share (thebid price) and the price the seller is willing to accept (theask price) will be fairly close to each other.
investors, then, will not have to give up unrealized gains for a quick sale. when thespreadbetween the bid and ask prices tightens, the market is more liquid, when it grows the market instead becomes more illiquid. markets for real estate are usually far less liquid than stock markets. the liquidity of markets for other assets, such as derivatives, contracts, currencies, or commodities, often depends on their size, and how many open exchanges exist for them to be traded on.
accounting liquidity measures the ease with which an individual or company can meet their financial obligations with the liquid assets available to them—the ability to pay off debts as they come due.
in the example above, the rare book collector's assets are relatively illiquid and would probably not be worth their full value of $1,000 in a pinch. in investment terms, assessing accounting liquidity means comparing liquid assets tocurrent liabilities, or financial obligations that come due within one year.
there are a number of ratios that measure accounting liquidity, which differ in how strictly they define ""liquid assets."" analysts and investors use these to identify companies with strong liquidity. it is also considered a measure ofdepth.
financial analysts look at a firm's ability to use liquid assets to cover its short-term obligations. generally, when using these formulas, a ratio greater than one is desirable.
thecurrent ratiois the simplest and least strict. it measurescurrent assets(those that can reasonably be converted to cash in one year) against current liabilities. its formula would be:
thequick ratio, oracid-test ratio, is slightly more strict. it excludesinventoriesand other current assets, which are not as liquid as cash andcash equivalents, accounts receivable, and short-term investments. the formula is:
a variation of the quick/acid-test ratio simply subtracts inventory from current assets, making it a bit more generous:
thecash ratiois the most exacting of the liquidity ratios. excluding accounts receivable, as well as inventories and other current assets, it defines liquid assets strictly as cash or cash equivalents.
more than the current ratio or acid-test ratio, the cash ratio assesses an entity's ability to stay solvent in the case of an emergency—the worst-case scenario—on the grounds that even highly profitable companies can run into trouble if they do not have the liquidity to react to unforeseen events. its formula is:
in terms of investments, equities as a class are among the mostliquid assets. but not all equities are created equal when it comes to liquidity. some shares trade more actively than others on stock exchanges, meaning there is more of a market for them. in other words, they attract greater, more consistent interest from traders and investors. these liquid stocks are usually identifiable by their daily volume, which can be in the millions, or even hundreds of millions, of shares.
for example, on april 26, 2019, 8.4 million shares of amazon.com (amzn) traded on thenasdaq. while that amount may sound like good liquidity, it is still far less liquid than, say, intel (intc), which led the nasdaq that day, with a volume of 72 million shares—or to ford motor (f), which led thenew york stock exchange(nyse) with a volume of 156 million shares, making it the most liquid stock in the u.s. that day.
if markets are not liquid, it becomes difficult to sell or convert assets or securities into cash. you may, for instance, own a very rare and valuable family heirloom appraised at $150,000. however, if there is not market (i.e. no buyers) for your object, then it is irrelevant since nobody will pay anywhere close to its appraised value—it is very illiquid. it may even require hiring an auction house to act as a broker and track down potentially interested parties, which will take time and incur costs.
liquid assets, however, can be easily and quickly sold for their full value and with little cost. companies also must hold enough liquid assets to cover their short-term obligations like bills or payroll or else face a liquidity crisis, which could lead to bankruptcy.
cash is the most liquid asset followed by cash equivalents, which are things like money markets, cds, or time deposits. marketable securities such as stocks and bonds listed on exchanges are often very liquid and can be sold quickly via a broker. gold coins and certain collectibles may also be readily sold for cash.
securities that are tradedover-the-counter(otc) such as certain complex derivatives are often quite illiquid. for individuals, a home, a timeshare, or a car are all somewhat illiquid in that it may take several weeks to months to find a buyer, and several more weeks to finalize the transaction and receive payment. moreover, broker fees tend to be quite large (e.g., 5-7% on average for a realtor).
the most liquid stocks tend to be those with a great deal of interest from various market actors and a lot of daily transaction volume. such stocks will also attract a larger number of market makers who maintain a tighter two-sided market. illiquid stocks have wider bid-ask spreads and less market depth. these names tend to be lesser-known, have lower trading volume, and often also have lower market value and volatility. thus the stock for a large multi-national bank will tend to be more liquid than that of a small regional bank.

Definition, Types, and Examples",,,Adam BaroneDavid KindnessTimothy Li,"an asset is a resource witheconomic valuethat an individual, corporation, or country owns or controls with the expectation that it will provide a future benefit.
assets are reported on a company's balance sheet. they're classified as current, fixed, financial, and intangible. they are bought or created to increase a firm's value or benefit the firm's operations.
an asset can be thought of as something that, in the future, can generate cash flow, reduce expenses, or improve sales, regardless of whether it's manufacturing equipment or a patent.
an asset represents an economic resource owned or controlled by, for example, a company. an economic resource is something that may be scarce and has the ability to produce economic benefit by generating cash inflows or decreasing cash outflows.
an asset can also represent access that other individuals or firms do not have. furthermore, a right or other type of access can be legally enforceable, which means economic resources can be used at a company's discretion. their use can be precluded or limited by an owner.
for something to be considered an asset, a company must possess a right to it as of the date of the company's financial statements.
assets can be broadly categorized into current (or short-term) assets,fixed assets, financial investments, and intangible assets.
in accounting, some assets are referred to as current.current assetsare short-term economic resources that are expected to be converted into cash or consumed within one year. current assets include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, and various prepaid expenses.
while cash is easy to value, accountants periodically reassess the recoverability of inventory and accounts receivable. if there is evidence that a receivable might be uncollectible, it'll be classified as impaired. or if inventory becomes obsolete, companies may write off these assets.
some assets are recorded on companies' balance sheets using the concept of historical cost. historical cost represents the original cost of the asset when purchased by a company. historical cost can also include costs (such as delivery and set up) incurred to incorporate an asset into the company's operations.
fixed assets are resources with an expected life of greater than a year, such as plants, equipment, and buildings. an accounting adjustment calleddepreciationis made for fixed assets as they age. it allocates the cost of the asset over time. depreciation may or may not reflect the fixed asset's loss of earning power.
generally accepted accounting principles (gaap)allow depreciation under several methods. the straight-line method assumes that a fixed asset loses its valuein proportion to its useful life, while theaccelerated methodassumes that the asset loses its value faster in its first years of use.
financial assets represent investments in the assets and securities of other institutions. financial assets include stocks, sovereign and corporate bonds, preferred equity, and other, hybrid securities. financial assets are valued according to the underlying security and market supply and demand.
intangible assets are economic resources that have no physical presence. they include patents, trademarks, copyrights, and goodwill. accounting for intangible assets differs depending on the type of asset. they can be either amortized or tested for impairment each year.
while an asset is something with economic value that's owned or controlled by a person or company, a liability is something that is owed by a person or company. a liability could be a loan, taxes payable, or accounts payable.
when looking at an asset definition, you'll typically find that it is something that provides a current, future, or potential economic benefit for an individual or company. an asset is, therefore, something that is owned by you or something that is owed to you. a $10 bill, a desktop computer, a chair, and a car are all assets. if you loaned money to someone, that loan is also an asset because you are owed that amount. for the person who owes it, the loan is a liability.
personal assets can include a home, land, financial securities, jewelry, artwork, gold and silver, or your checking account. business assets can include such things as motor vehicles, buildings, machinery, equipment, cash, and accounts receivable.
non-physical or intangible assets provide an economic benefit even though you cannot physically touch them. they are an important class of assets that include things like intellectual property (e.g., patents or trademarks), contractual obligations, royalties, and goodwill. brand equity and reputation are also examples of non-physical or intangible assets that can be quite valuable.
no. labor is the work carried out by human beings, for which they are paid in wages or a salary. labor is distinct from assets, which are considered to becapital.
in accounting, assets are categorized by their time horizon of use. current assets are expected to be sold or used within one year. fixed assets, also known asnoncurrent assets, are expected to be in use for longer than one year. fixed assets are not easily liquidated. as a result, unlike current assets, fixed assets undergodepreciation.

24b30b71-8890-53ab-8170-93099c70ab73,Investopedia,Strategy & Education,Volatility: Meaning In Finance and How it Works with Stocks,,,Adam HayesCharles PottersPete Rathburn,"volatility is a statistical measure of thedispersionof returns for a given security or market index. in most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security. volatility is often measured from either thestandard deviationorvariancebetween returns from that same security or market index.
in the securities markets, volatility is often associated with big swings in either direction. for example, when the stock market rises and falls more than one percent over a sustained period of time, it is called a ""volatile"" market. an asset's volatility is a key factor when pricing options contracts.
volatility often refers to the amount of uncertainty or risk related to the size of changes in a security's value. a higher volatility means that a security's value can potentially be spread out over a larger range of values. this means that the price of the security can change dramatically over a short time period in either direction. a lower volatility means that a security's value does not fluctuate dramatically, and tends to be more steady.
one way to measure an asset's variation is to quantify the daily returns (percent move on a daily basis) of the asset. historical volatility is based on historical prices and represents the degree of variability in the returns of an asset. this number is without a unit and is expressed as a percentage.
while variance captures the dispersion of returns around the mean of an asset in general, volatility is a measure of that variance bounded by a specific period of time. thus, we can report daily volatility, weekly, monthly, or annualized volatility. it is, therefore, useful to think of volatility as the annualized standard deviation.
volatility is often calculated using variance and standard deviation (the standard deviation is the square root of the variance). since volatility describes changes over a specific period of time you simply take the standard deviation and multiply that by the square root of the number of periods in question:
where:
for simplicity, let's assume we have monthly stockclosing pricesof $1 through $10. for example, month one is $1, month two is $2, and so on. to calculate variance, follow the five steps below.
in this case, the resulting variance is $8.25. the square root is taken to get the standard deviation. this equals $2.87. this is a measure of risk and shows how values are spread out around the average price. it gives traders an idea of how far the price may deviate from the average.
investopedia / sabrina jiang
if prices are randomly sampled from a normal distribution, then about 68% of all data values will fall within one standard deviation. ninety-five percent of data values will fall within two standard deviations (2 x 2.87 in our example), and 99.7% of all values will fall within three standard deviations (3 x 2.87). in this case, the values of $1 to $10 are not randomly distributed on abell curve; rather. they are uniformly distributed. therefore, the expected 68%–95%º–99.7% percentages do not hold. despite this limitation, traders frequently use standard deviation, as price returns data sets often resemble more of a normal (bell curve) distribution than in the given example.
the volatility of stock prices is thought to bemean-reverting, meaning that periods of high volatility often moderate and periods of low volatility pick up, fluctuating around some long-term mean.
implied volatility(iv), also known as projected volatility, is one of the most important metrics for options traders. as the name suggests, it allows them to make a determination of just how volatile the market will be going forward. this concept also gives traders a way to calculate probability. one important point to note is that it shouldn't be considered science, so it doesn't provide a forecast of how the market will move in the future.
unlike historical volatility, implied volatility comes from the price of an option itself and represents volatility expectations for the future. because it is implied, traders cannot use past performance as an indicator of future performance. instead, they have to estimate the potential of the option in the market.
implied volatility is a key feature of options trading.
also referred to as statistical volatility,historical volatility(hv) gauges the fluctuations of underlying securities by measuring price changes over predetermined periods of time. it is the less prevalent metric compared to implied volatility because it isn't forward-looking.
when there is a rise in historical volatility, a security's price will also move more than normal. at this time, there is an expectation that something will or has changed. if the historical volatility is dropping, on the other hand, it means any uncertainty has been eliminated, so things return to the way they were.
this calculation may be based onintradaychanges, but often measures movements based on the change from one closing price to the next. depending on the intended duration of the options trade, historical volatility can be measured in increments ranging anywhere from 10 to 180 trading days.
volatility is a key variable in options pricing models, estimating the extent to which the return of theunderlying assetwill fluctuate between now and the option's expiration. volatility, as expressed as a percentage coefficient within option-pricing formulas, arises from daily trading activities. how volatility is measured will affect the value of the coefficient used.
volatility is also used to price options contracts using models likeblack-scholesorbinomial treemodels. more volatile underlying assets will translate to higher options premiums because with volatility there is a greater probability that the options will end up in-the-money at expiration. options traders try to predict an asset's future volatility, so the price of an option in the market reflects its implied volatility.
the greater the volatility, the higher the market price of options contracts across the board.
one measure of the relative volatility of a particular stock to the market is its beta (β). abetaapproximates the overall volatility of a security's returns against the returns of a relevantbenchmark(usually the s&p 500 is used). for example, a stock with abeta valueof 1.1 has historically moved 110% for every 100% move in the benchmark, based onprice level.
conversely, a stock with a beta of .9 has historically moved 90% for every 100% move in the underlying index.
market volatility can also be seen through thevixor volatility index, a numeric measure of broad market volatility. the vix was created by the chicago board options exchange as a measure to gauge the 30-day expected volatility of the u.s. stock market derived from real-time quote prices of s&p 500 call and putoptions.it is effectively a gauge of future bets investors and traders are making on the direction of the markets or individual securities. a high reading on the vix implies a risky market.
traders can also trade the vix using a variety of options and exchange-traded products, or they can use vix values to price certain derivatives products.
suppose that an investor is building a retirement portfolio. since she is retiring within the next few years, she's seeking stocks with low volatility and steady returns. she considers two companies:
a more conservative investor may choose acorporation for their portfolio, since it has less volatility and more predictable short-term value
investors can find periods of high volatility to be distressing as prices can swing wildly or fall suddenly. long-term investors are best advised to ignore periods of short-term volatility and stay the course. this is because over the long run, stock markets tend to rise. meanwhile, emotions like fear and greed, which can become amplified in volatility markets, can undermine your long-term strategy. some investors can also use volatility as an opportunity to add to their portfolios by buying the dips, when prices are relatively cheap.
you can also use hedging strategies to navigate volatility, such as buyingprotective putsto limit downside losses without having to sell any shares. but note that put options will also become more pricey when volatility is higher.
volatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of data around its mean over a certain period of time. it's calculated as the standard deviation multiplied by the square root of the number of periods of time, t. in finance, it represents this dispersion of market prices, on an annualized basis.
volatility is often used to describe risk, but this is necessarily always the case. risk involves the chances of experiencing a loss, while volatility describes how large and quickly prices move. if those increased price movements also increase the chance of losses, then risk is likewise increased.
whether volatility is a good or bad thing depends on what kind of trader you are and what your risk appetite is. for long-term investors, volatility can spell trouble, but for day traders and options traders, volatility often equals trading opportunities.
if volatility is high, it means that prices are moving (both up and down) quickly and steeply.
the vix is the cboe volatility index, a measure of the short-term volatility in the broader market, measured by the implied volatility of 30-day s&p 500 options contracts. the vix generally rises when stocks fall, and declines when stocks rise. also known as the ""fear index,"" the vix can thus be a gauge of market sentiment, with higher values indicating greater volatility and greater fear among investors.
volatility is how much and how quickly prices move over a given span of time. in the stock market, increased volatility is often a sign of fear and uncertainty among investors. this is why the vix volatility index is sometimes called the ""fear index."" at the same time, volatility can create opportunities for day traders to enter and exit positions. volatility is also a key component in options pricing and trading.

e0e5bcb7-dc02-50c2-b86b-ff21f011c69e,Investopedia,Guide to Mutual Funds,Mutual Funds: Different Types and How They Are Priced,,,Adam HayesMichael J BoyleRyan Eichler,"a mutual fund is a financial vehicle that pools assets from shareholders to invest in securities like stocks, bonds, money market instruments, and other assets. mutual funds are operated by professionalmoney managers, who allocate the fund's assets and attempt to produce capital gains or income for the fund's investors. a mutual fund's portfolio is structured and maintained to match the investment objectives stated in itsprospectus.
mutual funds give small or individual investors access to professionally managed portfolios of equities, bonds, and other securities. each shareholder, therefore, participates proportionally in the gains or losses of the fund. mutual funds invest in a vast number of securities, and performance is usually tracked as the change in the totalmarket capof the fund—derived by the aggregating performance of the underlying investments.
most mutual funds are part of larger investment companies such as fidelity investments, vanguard, t. rowe price, and oppenheimer. a mutual fund has afund manager, sometimes called itsinvestment adviser, who is legally obligated to work in the best interest of mutual fund shareholders.
the value of the mutual fund depends on the performance of the securities in which it invests. when buying a unit or share of a mutual fund, an investor is buying the performance of its portfolio or, more precisely, a part of the portfolio's value. investing in a share of a mutual fund is different from investing in shares of stock. unlike stock, mutual fund shares do not give their holders anyvoting rights. a share of a mutual fund represents investments in many different stocks or other securities.
theprice of a mutual fundshare is referred to as thenet asset value(nav) per share, sometimes expressed asnavps. a fund's nav is derived by dividing the total value of the securities in the portfolio by the total amount of shares outstanding. outstanding shares are those held by all shareholders, institutional investors, and company officers or insiders.
mutual fund shares can typically be purchased or redeemed at the fund's current nav, which doesn't fluctuate during market hours, but is settled at the end of each trading day. the price of a mutual fund is alsoupdatedwhen the navps is settled.
the average mutual fund holds different securities, which means mutual fund shareholders gain diversification. consider an investor who buys only google stock and relies on the success of the company's earnings. because all of their dollars are tied to one company, gains and losses are dependent on the company's success. however, a mutual fund may hold google in its portfolio where the gains and losses of just one stock are offset by gains and losses of other companies within the fund.
when an investor buys apple stock, they are buying partial ownership or a share of the company. similarly, a mutual fund investor is buying partial ownership of the mutual fund and its assets.
investors typically earn a return from a mutual fund in three ways, usually on a quarterly or annual basis:
when researching the returns of a mutual fund, an investor will see ""total return,"" or the change in value, either up or down, of an investment over a specific period. this includes any interest, dividends, or capital gains the fund generated as well as the change in its market value over some time. in most cases, total returns are calculated for one, five, and 10-year periods as well as since the day the fund opened, or the inception date.
there are several types of mutual funds available for investment, though most mutual funds fall into one of four main categories which include stock funds, money market funds, bond funds, and target-date funds.
as the name implies, this fund invests principally in equity or stocks. within this group are various subcategories. some equity funds are named for the size of the companies they invest in: small-, mid-, or large-cap. others are named by their investment approach: aggressive growth, income-oriented, value, and others. equity funds are also categorized by whether they invest in domestic (u.s.) stocks or foreign equities. to understand the universe of equity funds is to use a style box, an example of which is below.
funds can be classified based on both the size of the companies, theirmarket caps, and the growth prospects of the invested stocks. the termvalue fundrefers to a style of investing that looks for high-quality, low-growth companies that are out of favor with the market. these companies are characterized by lowprice-to-earnings(p/e) ratios, lowprice-to-book(p/b) ratios, and highdividend yields.
conversely,growth funds, look to companies that have had strong growth in earnings, sales, and cash flows. these companies typically have high p/e ratios and do not pay dividends. a compromise between strict value and growth investment is a ""blend,"" which simply refers to companies that are neither value nor growth stocks and are classified as being somewhere in the middle.
large-capcompanies have highmarket capitalizations, with values over $10 billion. market cap is derived by multiplying the share price by the number of shares outstanding. large-cap stocks are typicallyblue-chip firmsthat are often recognizable by name.small-cap stocksrefer to those stocks with a market cap ranging from $250 million to $2 billion. these smaller companies tend to be newer, riskier investments.mid-cap stocksfill in the gap between small- and large-cap.
a mutual fund may blend its strategy between investment style and company size. for example, a large-cap value fund would look to large-cap companies that are in strong financial shape but have recently seen their share prices fall and would be placed in the upper left quadrant of the style box (large and value). the opposite of this would be a fund that invests in startup technology companies with excellent growth prospects: small-cap growth. such a mutual fund would reside in the bottom right quadrant (small and growth).
a mutual fund that generates a minimum return is part of thefixed incomecategory. a fixed-income mutual fund focuses on investments that pay a set rate of return, such as government bonds, corporate bonds, or other debt instruments. the fund portfolio generates interest income, which is passed on to the shareholders.
sometimes referred to as bond funds, these funds are oftenactively managedand seek to buy relatively undervalued bonds in order to sell them at a profit. these mutual funds are likely to pay higher returns and bond funds aren't without risk. for example, a fund specializing in high-yield junk bonds is much riskier than a fund that invests in government securities.
because there are many different types of bonds, bond funds can vary dramatically depending on where they invest and all bond funds are subject tointerest rate risk.
index fundsinvest in stocks that correspond with a major market index such as the s&p 500 or the dow jones industrial average (djia). this strategy requires less research from analysts and advisors, so there are fewer expenses passed on to shareholders and these funds are often designed with cost-sensitive investors in mind.
balanced funds invest in a hybrid of asset classes, whether stocks, bonds,money marketinstruments, or alternative investments. the objective of this fund, known as an asset allocation fund, is to reduce the risk of exposure across asset classes.
some funds are defined with a specific allocation strategy that is fixed, so the investor can have a predictable exposure to various asset classes. other funds follow a strategy for dynamic allocation percentages to meet various investor objectives. this may include responding to market conditions, business cycle changes, or the changing phases of the investor's own life.
the portfolio manager is commonly given the freedom to switch the ratio of asset classes as needed to maintain the integrity of the fund's stated strategy.
the money market consists of safe,risk-free, short-term debt instruments, mostly governmenttreasury bills. an investor will not earn substantial returns, but the principal is guaranteed. a typical return is a little more than the amount earned in a regular checking or savings account and a little less than the averagecertificate of deposit(cd).
income fundsare named for their purpose: to provide current income on a steady basis. these funds invest primarily in government and high-quality corporate debt, holding these bonds until maturity to provide interest streams. while fund holdings may appreciate, the primary objective of these funds is to provide steadycash flow​ to investors. as such, the audience for these funds consists of conservative investors and retirees.
aninternational fund, or foreign fund, invests only in assets located outside an investor's home country.global funds, however, can invest anywhere around the world. their volatility often depends on the unique country's economy and political risks. however, these funds can be part of a well-balanced portfolio by increasingdiversification, since the returns in foreign countries may be uncorrelated with returns at home.
sector fundsare targeted strategy funds aimed at specific sectors of the economy, such as financial, technology, or healthcare. sector funds can be extremely volatile since the stocks in a given sector tend to be highlycorrelatedwith each other.
regional fundsmake it easier to focus on a specific geographic area of the world. this can mean focusing on a broader region or an individual country.
socially responsible funds, or ethical funds, invest only in companies that meet the criteria of certain guidelines or beliefs. for example, some socially responsible funds do not invest in ""sin"" industries such as tobacco, alcoholic beverages, weapons, or nuclear power. other funds invest primarily in green technology, such as solar and wind power or recycling.
a twist on the mutual fund is theexchange-traded fund(etf). they are not considered mutual funds but employ strategies consistent with mutual funds. they are structured as investment trusts that are traded on stock exchanges and have the added benefits of the features of stocks.
etfs can be bought and sold throughout the trading day. etfs can also besold shortor purchased onmargin. etfs also typically carry lower fees than the equivalent mutual fund. many etfs also benefit from activeoptionsmarkets, where investors canhedgeorleveragetheir positions.
etfs also enjoy tax advantages from mutual funds.compared to mutual funds, etfs tend to be more cost-effective and more liquid.
a mutual fund has annual operating fees or shareholder fees. annual fund operating fees are an annual percentage of the funds under management, usually ranging from 1–3%, known as theexpense ratio. a fund's expense ratio is the summation of the advisory or management fee and its administrative costs.
shareholder fees are sales charges, commissions, and redemption fees, that are paid directly by investors when purchasing or selling the funds. sales charges or commissions are known as ""the load"" of a mutual fund. when a mutual fund has afront-endload, fees are assessed when shares are purchased. for a back-end load, mutual fund fees are assessed when an investor sells their shares.
sometimes, however, an investment company offers a no-load mutual fund, which doesn't carry any commission or sales charge. these funds are distributed directly by an investment company, rather than through a secondary party. some funds also charge fees and penalties for early withdrawals or selling the holding before a specific time has elapsed.
currently, most individual investors purchase mutual funds witha-sharesthrough a broker. this purchase includes a front-end load of up to 5% or more, plus management fees and ongoing fees for distributions, also known as 12b-1 fees. financial advisors selling these products may encourage clients to buy higher-load offerings to generate commissions. with front-end funds, the investor pays these expenses as they buy into the fund.
to remedy these problems and meet fiduciary-rule standards, investment companies have started designating new share classes, including ""level load""c shares, which generally don't have a front-end load but carry a 12b-1 annual distribution fee of up to 1%.
funds that charge management and other fees when an investor sells their holdings are classified asclass b shares.
there are a variety of reasons that mutual funds have been the retail investor's vehicle of choice with an overwhelming majority of money in employer-sponsored retirement plans invested in mutual funds.
diversification, or the mixing of investments and assets within a portfolio to reduce risk, is one of theadvantagesof investing in mutual funds. a diversified portfolio has securities with different capitalizations and industries and bonds with varying maturities and issuers. buying a mutual fund can achieve diversification cheaper and faster than buying individual securities.
trading on the major stock exchanges, mutual funds can be bought and sold with relative ease, making them highly liquid investments. also, when it comes to certain types of assets, like foreign equities or exotic commodities, mutual funds are often the most feasible way—in fact, sometimes the only way—for individual investors toparticipate.
mutual funds also provideeconomies of scaleby forgoing numerous commission charges needed to create a diversified portfolio. buying only one security at a time leads to large transaction fees. the smaller denominations of mutual funds allow investors to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.
because a mutual fund buys and sells large amounts of securities at a time, itstransaction costsare lower than what an individual would pay for securities transactions. a mutual fund can invest in certain assets or take larger positions than a smaller investor could.
a professionalinvestment manageruses careful research and skillful trading. a mutual fund is a relatively inexpensive way for a small investor to get a full-time manager to make and monitor investments. mutual funds require much lower investment minimums so these funds provide a low-cost way for individual investors to experience and benefit from professional money management.
investors have the freedom to research and select from managers with a variety of styles and management goals. a fund manager may focus on value investing,growth investing, developed markets, emerging markets, income, or macroeconomic investing, among many other styles. this variety allows investors to gain exposure to not only stocks and bonds but alsocommodities, foreign assets, and real estate through specialized mutual funds. mutual funds provide opportunities for foreign and domestic investment that may not otherwise be directly accessible to ordinary investors.
mutual funds are subject to industry regulation that ensures accountability and fairness to investors.
liquidity
diversification
minimal investment requirements
professional management
variety of offerings
high fees, commissions, and other expenses
large cash presence in portfolios
no fdic coverage
difficulty in comparing funds
lack of transparency in holdings
liquidity, diversification, and professional management all make mutual funds attractive options, however, mutual funds have drawbacks too.
like many other investments without a guaranteed return, there is always the possibility that the value of your mutual fund willdepreciate. equity mutual funds experience price fluctuations, along with the stocks in the fund's portfolio. the federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic) does not guarantee mutual fund investments.
mutual funds require a significant amount of their portfolios to be held in cash to satisfy share redemptions each day. to maintainliquidityand the capacity to accommodate withdrawals, funds typically have to keep a larger portion of their portfolio as cash than a typical investor might. because cash earns no return, it is often referred to as a ""cash drag.""
mutual funds provide investors with professional management, but fees reduce the fund's overall payout, and they're assessed to mutual fund investors regardless of the performance of the fund. since fees vary widely from fund to fund, failing to pay attention to the fees can have negative long-term consequences as actively managed funds incur transaction costs that accumulate over each year.
""diworsification""—a play on words—is an investment or portfolio strategy that implies too much complexity can lead to worse results. many mutual fund investors tend to overcomplicate matters. that is, they acquire too many funds that are highly related and, as a result, lose the benefits of diversification.
dilutionis also the result of a successful fund growing too big. when new money pours into funds that have had strong track records, the manager often has trouble finding suitable investments for all the new capital to be put to good use.
the securities and exchange commission (sec) requires that funds have at least 80% of assets in the particular type of investment implied in their names. how the remaining assets are invested is up to the fund manager.however, the different categories that qualify for the required 80% of the assets may be vague and wide-ranging. a fund can, therefore, manipulate prospective investors via its title. a fund that focuses narrowly on congolese stocks, for example, could be sold with a far-ranging title like ""international high-tech fund.""
a mutual fund allows you to request that your shares be converted into cash at any time, however, unlike stock that trades throughout the day, many mutual fundredemptions​ take place only at the end of each trading day.
when a fund manager sells a security, a capital-gains tax is triggered. taxes can be mitigated by investing in tax-sensitive funds or by holding non-tax-sensitive mutual funds in atax-deferredaccount, such as a401(k)orira.
researching and comparing funds can be difficult. unlike stocks, mutual funds do not offer investors the opportunity to juxtapose the price to earnings (p/e) ratio, sales growth,earnings per share(eps), or other important data. a mutual fund's net asset value can offer some basis for comparison, but given the diversity of portfolios, comparing the proverbial apples to apples can be difficult, even among funds with similar names or stated objectives. only index funds tracking the same markets tend to be genuinely comparable.
one of the most notable mutual funds is fidelity investments' magellan fund (fmagx). established in 1963, the fund had an investment objective of capital appreciation via investment in common stocks.the fund's height of success was between 1977 and 1990 when peter lynch served as its portfolio manager. under lynch's tenure, magellan's assets under management increased from $18 million to $14 billion.
fidelity's performance continued strong, and assets under management (aum) grew to nearly $110 billion in 2000. by 1997, the fund had become so large that fidelity closed it to new investors and would not reopen it until 2008.
as of march 2022, fidelity magellan has nearly $28 billion in assets and has been managed by sammy simnegar since feb. 2019.the fund's performance has tracked or slightly surpassed that of the s&p 500.
all investments involve some degree of risk when purchasing securities such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. unlike deposits at fdic-insured banks and ncua-insured credit unions, the money invested in securities typically is not federally insured.
mutual funds are considered liquid assets and shares can be sold at any time, however, review the fund's policies regarding exchange fees or redemption fees. there may also be tax implications for capital gains earned with a mutual fund redemption.
when investing in a 401(k) or other retirement savings account, target-date funds, or life-cycle funds, are a popular option. choosing a fund that is dated around retirement, like fund x 2050, the fund promises to rebalance and shift the risk profile of its investments, commonly to a more conservative approach, as the fund approaches the target date.

a8656c57-e48f-577f-bd20-b7173ca1752f,Investopedia,Taxes,What Is the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)? How Auditing Works,,,Troy SegalLea D. UraduYarilet Perez,"the internal revenue service (irs) isa u.s. government agency responsible for the collection of taxes and enforcement of tax laws(such as thewash sale rule).established in 1862 by then-president abraham lincoln, the agency operates under the authority of the u.s.department of the treasury, and its primary purpose is the collection of individual income taxes and employment taxes. the irs also handlescorporate,gift,excise, andestate taxes.
as of november 2021, the head of the irs is commissioner charles p. rettig, who was nominated to the post by then-president donald trump in 2018.he oversees a workforce of about 80,000 and a budget of more than $11 billion.a graduate of new york university, rettig is the first commissioner since the 1990s to come to the job from a career in tax law rather than business management.
headquartered in washington, d.c., the irs services the taxation of all american individuals and companies. forfiscal year (fy)2020 (oct. 1, 2019, through sept. 30, 2020), it processed more than 240 million income tax returns and other forms. during that period, the irs collected more than $3.5 trillion in revenue and issued more than $736 billion intax refunds(which included $268 billion in economic impact payments due to the covid-19 pandemic).
individuals and corporations have the option to file income tax returns electronically, thanks to computer technology, software programs, and secure internet connections. the number of income tax returns that usee-filehas grown steadily since the irs began the program, and the overwhelming majority are now filed this way. during fy 2020, nearly 94.3% of all individual returns made use of the e-file option.by comparison, only about 40 million out of nearly 131 million returns, or nearly 31%, used it in 2001.
as of october 2021, just over 112 million taxpayers received their refunds throughdirect depositrather than by a traditional paper check, and the average direct-deposited amount was $2,851.
although the irs recommends filing tax returns electronically, it does not endorse any particular platform or filing software.
as part of its enforcement mission, the irsaudits a select portion of income tax returnsevery year. for fy 2020, the agency audited 509,917 tax returns. this number breaks down to 0.63% of individual income tax returns and 1.0% of corporate tax returns. around 72.6% of irs audits occurred through correspondence, while 27.4% happened in the field.
after rising to a peak in 2010, the number of audits has dropped steadily each year.the amount of funding set aside for tax enforcement has declined by about 30% from 2010 to 2020, which indicates that even fewer audits should occur.
reasons for an irs audit vary, but some factors may increase the odds of an examination. chief among them is higher income.in 2020, the audit rate for all individual income tax returns was 0.63%. however, for someone who made more than $10 million, it was 9.8%.
running your own business also carries greater risks. individuals making $200,000 to $1 million in 2018 who didn’t file schedule c (the form for theself-employed)had a 0.6% chance of being audited, vs. 1.4%—basically double—for those who did.
other red flags for an audit include failing to declare the right amount of income, claiming a higher-than-normal amount ofdeductions(especially business-related ones), making disproportionately largecharitable donationscompared to income, and claiming rental real estate losses.no single factor determines who does or does not face an irs audit each year.
there are numerous ways to contact the irs. if you are filing a tax return by mail, your state of residence and whether or not you are expecting a tax refund will determine the address that you should use. there is a list on the irs website.if you are sending an application or a payment, there is also a list on the irs website of mailing addresses depending on your purpose.
individuals who want assistance can phone (800) 829-1040, monday through friday, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. eastern time (et), and there are other toll-free numbers for businesses and other purposes.however, it can take some doing to reach an actual person. cpa amy northard has helpfully decoded the process on her blog, and it involves a lengthy series of responses you must make to automated questions. investopedia has vetted it for accuracy.for online assistance for a variety of questions, use the interactive tax assistant on the irs website.
you can also set up an in-person appointment by phone at your local irs office.the irs website has a locator page into which you merely type your zip code to get the office location and phone number.
you can pay your taxes to the irs through an electronic transfer of funds from your bank account or by using a debit or credit card. other methods include a same-day bank wire or an electronic funds withdrawal at the time that you e-file your return. if you are a business, or if you are making a large payment, you can use the electronic federal tax paying system, but you must first enroll in it.
if you are not paying electronically, you have other options. you can mail in a personal check, cashier’s check, or money order. make it payable to “u.s. treasury,” and be sure that it contains the following information:
you may pay in cash if you wish, you may, but never send cash through the mail. instead, make an in-person appointment at an irs taxpayer assistance center by calling (844) 545-5640, monday through friday, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. et. you should call 30 to 60 days before the day when you want to pay.
you can also pay cash at one of the irs retail partners: 7-eleven, ace cash express, casey’s general stores, cvs pharmacy, family dollar, dollar general, walgreens, pilot flying j, speedway, kum & go, stripes, royal farms, gomart, and kwik trip. this involves first getting a payment code sent to you by the irs via email, which you must present when making your payment. there is a limit of $1,000 per payment.
the irs was established in 1862 by then-president abraham lincoln, who instituted an income tax to pay for the civil war. the tax was repealed in 1872, revived in 1894, and declared unconstitutional by the u.s. supreme court in 1895. in 1913, the 16th amendment to the u.s. constitution reinstated the federal income tax.
it’s best to file your taxes electronically, which 94.3% of taxpayers did in 2020. you can still file a paper return by mail, but doing so will delay your receipt of any refund.
the most popular way to pay your taxes is by electronic transfer, either directly from your bank account or through a debit or credit card. however, you can also pay by check or money order, and you can even pay in person—using cash if you wish.
in 2020, the audit rate for individual tax returns was 0.63%. however, your chances go up if you make big bucks. the 2020 rate for people making $10 million or more was 9.8%. however, no one single factor determines whether or not the irs will audit you.

8f4a0ebf-1124-501b-bbcd-822784dbc4ed,Investopedia,Financial Statements,"Balance Sheet: Explanation, Components, and Examples",,,Jason FernandoMargaret James,"the term balance sheet refers to a financial statement that reports a company's assets, liabilities, and shareholder equity at a specific point in time. balance sheets provide the basis for computing rates of return for investors and evaluating a company'scapital structure.
in short, the balance sheet is afinancial statementthat provides a snapshot of what a company owns and owes, as well as the amount invested by shareholders. balance sheets can be used with other important financial statements to conduct fundamental analysis or calculate financial ratios.
thebalance sheet provides an overviewof the state of a company's finances at a moment in time. it cannot give a sense of the trends playing out over a longer period on its own. for this reason, the balance sheet should be compared with those of previous periods.
investorscan get a senseof a company's financial wellbeing by using a number of ratios that can be derived from a balance sheet, including thedebt-to-equity ratioand theacid-test ratio, along with many others. the income statement and statement of cash flows also provide valuable context for assessing a company's finances, as do any notes or addenda in an earnings report that might refer back to the balance sheet.
the balance sheet adheres to the following accounting equation, with assets on one side, and liabilities plus shareholder equity on the other, balance out:
this formula is intuitive. that's because a company has to pay for all the things it owns (assets) by either borrowing money (taking on liabilities) or taking it from investors (issuing shareholder equity).
if a company takes out a five-year, $4,000loanfrom a bank, itsassets(specifically, the cash account) will increase by $4,000. itsliabilities(specifically, the long-term debt account) will also increase by $4,000, balancing the two sides of the equation. if the company takes $8,000 from investors, its assets will increase by that amount, as will its shareholder equity. all revenues the company generates in excess of its expenses will go into the shareholder equity account. these revenues will be balanced on the assets side, appearing as cash, investments, inventory, or other assets.
balance sheets should also be compared with those of other businesses in the same industry since different industries have unique approaches to financing.
as noted above, you can find information about assets, liabilities, and shareholder equity on a company's balance sheet. the assets should always equal the liabilities and shareholder equity. this means that thebalance sheet should always balance, hence the name. if they don't balance, there may be some problems, including incorrect or misplaced data, inventory or exchange rate errors, or miscalculations.
each category consists of several smaller accounts that break down the specifics of a company's finances. these accounts vary widely by industry, and the same terms can have different implications depending on the nature of the business. but there are a few common components that investors are likely to come across.

accounts within this segment are listed from top to bottom in order of theirliquidity. this is the ease with which they can be converted into cash. they are divided into current assets, which can be converted to cash in one year or less; and non-current or long-term assets, which cannot.
here is thegeneral orderof accounts within current assets:
long-term assets include the following:
a liability is any money that a company owes to outside parties, from bills it has to pay to suppliers to interest onbondsissued to creditors to rent, utilities and salaries. current liabilities are due within one year and are listed in order of their due date. long-term liabilities, on the other hand, are due at any point after one year.
current liabilitiesaccounts might include:
long-term liabilitiescan include:
some liabilities are considered off the balance sheet, meaning they do not appear on the balance sheet.
shareholder equityis the money attributable to the owners of a business or its shareholders. it is also known as net assets since it is equivalent to the total assets of a company minus its liabilities or the debt it owes to non-shareholders.
retained earningsare the net earnings a company either reinvests in the business or uses to pay off debt. the remaining amount is distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends.
treasury stock is the stock a company has repurchased. it can be sold at a later date to raise cash or reserved to repel ahostile takeover.
some companies issuepreferred stock, which will be listed separately fromcommon stockunder this section. preferred stock is assigned an arbitrary par value (as is common stock, in some cases) that has no bearing on the market value of the shares. the common stock and preferred stock accounts are calculated by multiplying the par value by the number of shares issued.
additional paid-in capital orcapital surplusrepresents the amount shareholders have invested in excess of the common or preferred stock accounts, which are based on par value rather than market price. shareholder equity is not directly related to a company'smarket capitalization. the latter is based on the current price of a stock, while paid-in capital is the sum of the equity that has been purchased at any price.
par value is often just a very small amount, such as $0.01.
regardless of the size of a company or industry in which it operates, there are many benefits of a balance sheet,
balance sheets determine risk. this financial statement lists everything a company owns and all of its debt. a company will be able to quickly assess whether it has borrowed too much money, whether the assets it owns are not liquid enough, or whether it has enough cash on hand to meet current demands.
balance sheets are also used to secure capital. a company usually must provide a balance sheet to a lender in order to secure a business loan. a company must also usually provide a balance sheet to private investors when attempting to secureprivate equityfunding. in both cases, the external party wants to assess the financial health of a company, the creditworthiness of the business, and whether the company will be able to repay its short-term debts.
managers can opt to use financial ratios to measure the liquidity, profitability, solvency, and cadence (turnover) of a company using financial ratios, and some financial ratios need numbers taken from the balance sheet. when analyzed over time or comparatively against competing companies, managers can better understand ways to improve the financial health of a company.
last, balance sheets can lure and retain talent. employees usually prefer knowing their jobs are secure and that the company they are working for is in good health. for public companies that must disclose their balance sheet, this requirement gives employees a chance to review how much cash the company has on hand, whether the company is making smart decisions when managing debt, and whether they feel the company's financial health is in line with what they expect from their employer.
although the balance sheet is an invaluable piece of information for investors and analysts, there are some drawbacks. because it is static, many financial ratios draw on data included in both the balance sheet and the more dynamic income statement andstatement of cash flowsto paint a fuller picture of what's going on with a company's business. for this reason, a balance alone may not paint the full picture of a company's financial health.
a balance sheet is limited due its narrow scope of timing. the financial statement only captures the financial position of a company on a specific day. looking at a single balance sheet by itself may make it difficult to extract whether a company is performing well. for example, imagine a company reports $1,000,000 of cash on hand at the end of the month. without context, a comparative point, knowledge of its previous cash balance, and an understanding of industry operating demands, knowing how much cash on hand a company has yields limited value.
different accounting systems and ways of dealing withdepreciationand inventories will also change the figures posted to a balance sheet. because of this, managers have some ability to game the numbers to look more favorable. pay attention to the balance sheet's footnotes in order to determine which systems are being used in their accounting and to look out forred flags.
last, a balance sheet is subject to several areas of professional judgement that may materially impact the report. for example, accounts receivable must be continually assessed for impairment and adjusted to reflect potential uncollectible accounts. without knowing which receivables a company is likely to actually receive, a company must make estimates and reflect their best guess as part of the balance sheet.
the image below is an example of a comparative balance sheet of apple, inc. this balance sheet compares the financial position of the company as of september 2020 to the financial position of the company from the year prior.
in this example, apple's total assets of $323.8 billion is segregated towards the top of the report. this asset section is broken into current assets and non-current assets, and each of these categories is broken into more specific accounts. a brief review of apple's assets shows that their cash on hand decreased, yet their non-current assets increased.
this balance sheet also reports apple's liabilities and equity, each with its own section in the lower half of the report. the liabilities section is broken out similarly as the assets section, with current liabilities and non-current liabilities reporting balances by account. the total shareholder's equity section reports common stock value, retained earnings, and accumulated other comprehensive income. apple's total liabilities increased, total equity decreased, and the combination of the two reconcile to the company's total assets.
the balance sheet is an essential tool used by executives, investors, analysts, and regulators to understand the current financial health of a business. it is generally used alongside the two other types of financial statements: the income statement and the cash flow statement.
balance sheets allow the user to get an at-a-glance view of the assets and liabilities of the company. the balance sheet can help users answer questions such as whether the company has a positive net worth, whether it has enough cash and short-term assets to cover its obligations, and whether the company is highly indebted relative to its peers.
the balance sheet includes information about a company’s assets and liabilities. depending on the company, this might include short-term assets, such as cash and accounts receivable, or long-term assets such as property, plant, and equipment (pp&e). likewise, its liabilities may include short-term obligations such as accounts payable and wages payable, or long-term liabilities such as bank loans and other debt obligations.
depending on the company, different parties may be responsible for preparing the balance sheet. for small privately-held businesses, the balance sheet might be prepared by the owner or by a company bookkeeper. for mid-size private firms, they might be prepared internally and then looked over by an external accountant.
public companies, on the other hand, are required to obtain external audits by public accountants, and must also ensure that their books are kept to a much higher standard. the balance sheets and other financial statements of these companies must be prepared in accordance withgenerally accepted accounting principles(gaap) and must be filed regularly with thesecurities and exchange commission(sec).
a balance sheet explains the financial position of a company at a specific point in time. as opposed to an income statement which reports financial information over a period of time, a balance sheet is used to determine the health of a company on a specific day.
a bank statement is often used by parties outside of a company to gauge the company's health. banks, lenders, and other institutions may calculate financial ratios off of the balance sheet balances to gauge how much risk a company carries, how liquid its assets are, and how likely the company will remain solvent.
a company can use its balance sheet to craft internal decisions, though the information presented is usually not as helpful as an income statement. a company may look at its balance sheet to measure risk, make sure it has enough cash on hand, and evaluate how it wants to raise more capital (through debt or equity).
a balance sheet is calculated by balancing a company's assets with its liabilities and equity. the formula is: total assets = total liabilities + total equity.
total assets is calculated as the sum of all short-term, long-term, and other assets. total liabilities is calculated as the sum of all short-term, long-term and other liabilities. total equity is calculated as the sum of net income, retained earnings, owner contributions, and share of stock issued.

calls with strikes that are higher than the market, or puts with strikes lower than the market, are instead out-of-the-money (otm), and only haveextrinsic value(also known astime value).
the strike price is a key variable of call and put options, which defines at which price the option holder can buy or sell the underlying security, respectively.
options are listed with several strike prices both above and below the current market value. say that a stock is trading at $100 per share. the $110-strike call option would give the holder the right to buy the stock at $110 on or before the date when the contract expires. this means that the option would lose value if the stock falls and gain in value as the underlying stock increases in price. but if it never reaches $110 before the expiration date, the call will expire worthless. this is because you could buy the stock for less. if the stock did rise above $110, you could still exercise the option to pay $110 even though the market price is higher. (put options would work similarly, but give you the right to sell rather than buy the underlying).
the strike prices listed are also standardized, meaning they are at fixed dollar amounts, such as $31, $32, $33, $100, $105, and so on. they may also have $2.50 intervals, such as $12.50, $15.00, and $17.50. the distance between strikes is known as thestrike width. strike prices and widths are set by the options exchanges.
generally, strikes $1.00 apart are the tightest available on most stocks. due to stock splits or other events, you may have strikes that result in $0.50 or tighter.
the price of an options contract is known as itspremium, which is the amount of money that the buyer of an option pays to the seller for the right, but not the obligation, to exercise the option. theprice differencebetween the underlying's market price and the strike price determines an option's value in what is known as themoneynessof the option.
the more ""in-the-money"" an option is, the higher its premium-as the difference between the strike and the underlying gets smaller, options become more valuable, and when the strike becomes greater they are in-the-money. similarly, an option will lose value as the difference between the strike and underlying price become larger and as the option falls out-of-the-money.
options can thus be either in-the-money (itm), out-of-the-money (otm), or at-the-money (atm).
for buyers of the call option (such as in the example above), if the strike price is higher than the underlying stock price, the option is out-of-the-money (otm). in this case, the option doesn't have intrinsic value, but it is likely to still have extrinsic value based on volatility and time until expiration, as either of these two factors could put the option in-the-money in the future. conversely, if the underlying stock price is above the strike price, the option will have intrinsic value and be in-the-money.
puts with strike prices higher than the current price will be in-the-money since you can sell the stock higher than the market price and then buy it back for a guaranteed profit. a put option will instead be in-the-money when the underlying stock price is below the strike price and be out-of-the-money when the underlying stock price is above the strike price. again, an otm option won't have intrinsic value, but it may still have value based on the volatility of the underlying asset and the time left until option expiration.
finally, an option with a strike price at or very near to the current market price is known asat-the-money(atm). atm options are often the most liquid and active options traded in a name.

an option'sdeltais how much its premium will change given a $1 move in the underlying. so, a call with a +0.40 delta will rise by 40 cents if the underlying rises by a dollar.
at-the-money calls have a delta of +0.50; at-the-money puts have a delta of -0.50. options that are in-the-money will have deltas greater than 0.50 (positively for calls, negatively for puts), and out-of-the-money options will have deltas less than 0.50.
an option with a delta of 1.00 is sodeep in-the-moneythat it essentially behaves like the stock itself. examples would be call options very far below the current price and puts with strikes very high above it. conversely,deep out-of-the-moneyoptions have deltas very close to zero and are essentially worthless because they are calls that have strikes so high above the market, or puts with strikes so far below it, that it is extremely unlikely they will ever be in the money before expiry.
pricing models were developed in the 1970s and '80s to help understand the fair value of an options contract, such as theblack-scholes modeland thebinomial tree model. theoretically, an options' premium should be related to the probability that it finishes in-the-money. the higher that probability, the greater the value of the right that the option grants.
regardless of what model is used, options prices always depend on the following five inputs
we've already seen how the difference between the market price and strike price fit into the equation. the time to expiration andvolatilityinputs indicate how likely it is for an option to finish in-the-money before it expires. the more time there is to go, and/or the more volatile the underlying's prices moves are, the more likely that the market price will reach the strike price. therefore, options with longer times until expiration and those with greater volatility will have higher premiums.
assume there are two option contracts. one is a call option with a $100 strike price. the other is a call option with a $150 strike price. the current price of the underlying stock is $145. assume both call options are the same; the only difference is the strike price.
if we have two put options, both about to expire, and one has a strike price of $40 and the other has a strike price of $50, we can look to the current stock price to see which option has value. if the underlying stock is trading at $45, the $50 put option has a $5 value. this is because the underlying stock is below the strike price of the put.
the $40 put option has no value because the underlying stock is above the strike price. recall that put options allow the option buyer to sell at the strike price. there is no point using the option to sell at $40 when they can sell at $45 in the stock market. therefore, the $40 strike price put is worthless at expiration.
the question of what strike price is most desirable will depend on factors such as the risk tolerance of the investor and the options premiums available from the market. for example, many investors will look for options whose strike prices are relatively close to the current market price of the security, based on the logic that those options have a higher probability of being exercised at a profit. at the same time, some investors will deliberately seek out options that are far out-of-the-money—that is, options whose strike prices are very far from the market price—in the hopes of realizing very large returns if the options do become profitable.
yes, the terms strike price and exercise price are synonymous. some traders will use one term over the other and may use the terms interchangeably, but their meanings are the same. both terms are widely used in derivatives trading.
for listed options, strike prices are set by criteria established bythe occor an exchange, typically with $2.50 distance for strikes below $25, $5 increments for those trading from $25 through $200, and $10 increments for strikes above $200.in general, the strikes will be wider for stocks with higher prices and with less liquidity or trading activity. new strikes may also be requested to be added by contacting the occ or an exchange.
the strike price of an option tells you at what price you can buy or sell the underlying security. when the option is exercised.
the spot price is another word for the current market price of the underlying security.
the difference between the strike price and the spot price determines an option's moneyness and greatly informs its value.
an option's strike price tells you at what price you can buy (in the case of a call) or sell (for a put) the underlying security before the contract expires. the difference between the strike price and the current market price is called the option's ""moneyness,"" a measure of its intrinsic value. in-the-money options have intrinsic value since they can be exercised at a strike price that is more favorable than the current market price, for a guaranteed profit. out-of-the-money options do not have intrinsic value, but still contain extrinsic, or time value since the underlying may move to the strike before expiration. at-the-money options have strikes at or very close to the current market price and are often the most liquid and active contracts in a name.

thedividend yieldis the dividend per share and is expressed as dividend/price as a percentage of a company's share price, such as 2.5%.
common shareholders of dividend-paying companies are eligible to receive a distribution as long as they own the stock before theex-dividend date.

dividends must be approved by the shareholders byvoting rights. although cash dividends are common, dividends can also be issued as shares of stock. various mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (etfs) also pay dividends.
a dividend is a reward paid to the shareholders for their investment in a company’s equity, and it usually originates from the company's net profits. though profits can be kept within the company asretained earningsto be used for the company’s ongoing and future business activities, a remainder can be allocated to the shareholders as a dividend.
companies may still make dividend payments even when they don’t make suitable profits to maintain their established track record of distributions.
the board of directors can choose to issue dividends over various time frames and with different payoutrates. dividends can be paid at a scheduled frequency, such as monthly, quarterly, or annually. for example, walmart inc. (wmt) and unilever (ul) make regular quarterly dividend payments.
companies can also issue non-recurringspecial dividends, either individually or in addition to a scheduled dividend. united bancorp inc. declared a 10 cents per share special dividend on feb. 18, 2022.
larger, established companies with predictable profits are often the best dividend payers and the following industry sectors maintain a regular record of dividend payments:
companies structured asmaster limited partnerships(mlps) andreal estate investment trusts(reits) require specified distributions to shareholders.funds may also issue regular dividend payments as stated in their investment objectives.
startups, such as those in the technology or biotech sectors, may not offer regular dividends since these companies may be in the early stages of development and retain earnings for research and development, business expansion, and operational activities.
dividend payments follow a chronological order of events, and the associated dates are important to determining which shareholders qualify to receive the dividend payment.
dividend payments impact share price and the price may rise on the announcement approximately by the amount of the dividend declared and then decline by a similar amount at the opening session of the ex-dividend date.
for example, a company that is trading at $60 per share declares a $2 dividend on the announcement date. as the news becomes public, the share price may increase by $2 and hit $62.
if the stock trades at $63 one business day before the ex-dividend date. on the ex-dividend date, it's adjusted by $2 and begins trading at $61 at the start of the trading session on the ex-dividend date, because anyone buying on the ex-dividend date will not receive the dividend.
this is not guaranteed but often the price adjusts by the dividend on the ex-dividend date.
dividends are often expected by the shareholders as a reward for their investment in a company. dividend payments reflect positively on a company and help maintain investors’ trust.
a high-value dividend declaration can indicate that the company is doing well and has generated good profits. but it can also indicate that the company does not have suitable projects to generate better returns in the future. therefore, it is utilizing its cash to pay shareholders instead of reinvesting it into growth.
a company with a long history of dividend payments that declares a reduction of the dividend amount, or its elimination, may signal to investors that the company is in trouble. at&t inc. cut its annual dividend in half to $1.11 on feb. 1, 2022, and its shares fell 4% that day.
however, a reduction in dividend amounts or a decision against a dividend payment may not necessarily translate into bad news for a company. the company's management may have a plan for investing the money such as a high-return project that has the potential to magnify returns for shareholders in the long run.
dividends paid by funds, such as a bond or mutual funds, are different from dividends paid by companies. funds employ the principle ofnet asset value(nav), which reflects the valuation of their holdings or the price of the assets that a fund has in its portfolio.
regular dividend payments should not be misunderstood as a stellar performance by the fund. for example, a bond-investing fund may pay monthly dividends because it receives monthly interest on its interest-bearing holdings and merely transfers the income from the interest fully or partially to the fund's investors.
a stock-investing fund pays dividends from the earnings received from the many stocks held in its portfolio or by selling a certain share of stocks and distributing capital gains.
economistsmerton millerandfranco modiglianiargued that a company'sdividend policy is irrelevantand has no effect on the price of a firm's stock or itscost of capital. a shareholder may remain indifferent to a company’s dividend policy as in the case of high dividend payments where an investor can just use the cash received to buy more shares.
if a dividend payout is lean, an investor can instead sell shares to generate the cash they need. in either case, the combination of the value of an investment in the company and the cash they hold will remain the same. miller and modigliani thus conclude that dividends are irrelevant, and investors shouldn’t care about the firm's dividend policy because they can create their own synthetically.however, dividends remain an attractive investment incentive, with additional earnings made available to shareholders.
investors seeking dividend investments have several options, including stocks, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (etfs). thedividend discount modelor thegordon growth modelcan help choose stock investments. these techniques rely on anticipated future dividend streams to value shares.
to compare multiple stocks based on their dividend payment performance, investors can use thedividend yieldfactor, which measures the dividend in terms of a percentage of the current market price of the company’s share.
the dividend rate can be quoted in terms of the dollar amount each share receives asdividends per share(dps). in addition to dividend yield, another important performance measure to assess the returns generated from a particular investment is the total return factor. this figure accounts forinterest, dividends, and increases in share price, among othercapital gains.
tax is another important consideration when investing in dividend gains. investors in high tax brackets often prefer dividend-paying stocks if their jurisdiction allows zero or comparatively lower tax on dividends. for example, greece and slovakia have a lower tax ondividend incomefor shareholders, while dividend gains are tax exempt in hong kong.
dividends are commonly distributed to shareholders quarterly, though some companies may pay dividends semi-annually. payments can be received as cash or as reinvestment into shares of company stock.
if a company's board of directors decides to issue an annual 5% dividend per share, and the company’s shares are worth $100, the dividend is $5. if the dividends are issued every quarter, each distribution is $1.25.
though dividends can signal that a company has stable cash flow and is generating profits, they can also provide investors with recurring revenue. dividend payouts may also help provide insight into a company’s intrinsic value. many countries also offer preferential tax treatment to dividends, where they are treated as tax-free income.

you may choose to hold and manage your portfolio yourself, or you may allow a money manager, financial advisor, or another finance professional to manage your portfolio.
one of the key concepts inportfolio managementis the wisdom ofdiversification—which simply means not putting all of your eggs in one basket. diversification tries to reduceriskby allocating investments among various financial instruments, industries, and other categories. it aims to maximize returns by investing in different areas that would each react differently to the same event. there are many ways to diversify.
how you choose to do it is up to you. your goals for the future, your appetite for risk, and your personality are all factors in deciding how to build your portfolio.
regardless of your portfolio's asset mix, all portfolios should contain some degree of diversification, and reflect the investor'stolerance for risk, return objectives, time horizon, and other pertinent constraints, including tax position, liquidity needs, legal situations, and unique circumstances.
the word""portfolio"" comes from the latinfolium,meaning to ""carry leaves"" (as in papers). stock and bond certificates were once only issued in paper form, from which this terminology was adopted. portfolio is also used to describe an artist's collection of works, for similar reasoning.
you may think of an investment portfolio as a pie that's been divided into pieces of varying wedge-shaped sizes, each piece representing a different asset class and/or type of investment. investors aim to construct a well-diversified portfolio to achieve arisk-return portfolio allocationthat is appropriate for their level of risk tolerance. although stocks, bonds, and cash are generally viewed as a portfolio's core building blocks, you may grow a portfolio with many different types of assets—including real estate,gold stocks, various types of bonds, paintings, and other art collectibles.
the sample portfolio allocation pictured above is for an investor with a low tolerance for risk. in general, a conservative strategy tries to protect a portfolio's value by investing in lower-risk securities. in the example, you'll see that a full 50% is allocated tobonds, which might contain high-grade corporates and government bonds, includingmunicipals(munis).
the 20% stock allocation could comprise blue-chip or large-cap equities, and 30% ofshort-term investmentsmight include cash, certificates of deposit (cds), and high-yield savings accounts.
most investment professionals agree that, though it does not guarantee against loss, diversification is a key component for reaching long-range financial goals while minimizing risk.
there can be as manydifferent types of portfoliosand portfolio strategies as there are investors and money managers. you also may choose to have multiple portfolios, whose contents could reflect a different strategy or investment scenario, structured for a different need.
the hybrid portfolio approach diversifies across asset classes. building a hybrid portfolio requires taking positions in stocks as well as bonds, commodities, real estate, and even art. generally, a hybrid portfolio entails relatively fixed proportions of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments. this is beneficial, because historically, stocks, bonds, and alternatives have exhibited less than perfect correlations with one another.
when you use a portfolio for investment purposes, you expect that the stock, bond, or another financial asset will earn a return or grow in value over time, or both. a portfolio investment may be eitherstrategic—where you buy financial assets with the intention of holding onto those assets for a long time; ortactical—where you actively buy and sell the asset hoping to achieve short-term gains.
the underlying assets in an aggressive portfolio generally would assume great risks in search of great returns. aggressive investors seek out companies that are in the early stages of their growth and have a uniquevalue proposition. most of them are not yet common household names.
a portfolio that is defensive would tend to focus onconsumer staplesthat are impervious to downturns. defensive stocks do well in bad times as well as in good times. no matter how bad the economy is at a given time, companies that make products that are essential to everyday life will survive.
this type of portfolio makes money from dividend-paying stocks or other types of distributions to stakeholders. some of the stocks in the income portfolio could also fit in the defensive portfolio, but here they are selected primarily for their high yields. an income portfolio should generate positive cash flow.real estate investment trusts(reits) are examples of income-producing investments.
a speculative portfolio is best for investors that have a high level of tolerance for risk. speculative plays could includeinitial public offerings(ipos) or stocks that are rumored to be takeover targets. technology or healthcare firms in the process of developing a single breakthrough product also would fall into this category.
although a financial advisor can create a generic portfolio model for an individual, an investor's risk tolerance should significantly reflect the portfolio's content.
in contrast, a risk-tolerant investor might add somesmall-capgrowth stocks to an aggressive, large-cap growth stock position, assume somehigh-yield bondexposure, and look to real estate, international, andalternative investmentopportunities for their portfolio. in general, an investor should minimize exposure to securities or asset classes whose volatility makes them uncomfortable.
similar to risk tolerance, investorsshould consider how long they have to investwhen building a portfolio. in general, investors should be moving toward a conservative asset allocation as their goal date approaches, to protect the portfolio's earnings up to that point.
for example, a conservative investor might favor a portfolio withlarge-cap value stocks, broad-basedmarket indexfunds, investment-grade bonds, and a position in liquid, high-gradecash equivalents.
take, for example, an investor saving for retirement who's planning to leave the workforce in five years. even if that investor is comfortable investing in stocks and riskier securities, they might want to invest a larger portion of the portfolio in more conservative assets such as bonds and cash, to help protect what has already been saved. conversely, an individual just entering the workforce may want to invest their entire portfolio in stocks, as they may have decades to invest, and the ability to ride out some of the market's short-termvolatility.
building an investment portfolio requires more effort than the passive, index investing approach. first, you need to identify your goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. then, research and select stocks or other investments that fit within those parameters. regular monitoring and updating is often required, along with entry and exit points for each position. rebalancing requires selling some holdings and buying more of others so that most of the time your portfolio’s asset allocation matches your strategy, risk tolerance, and desired level of returns. despite the extra effort required, defining and building a portfolio can increase your investing confidence and give you control over your finances.
a good portfolio will depend on your investment style, goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. generally speaking, a good degree of diversification is recommended regardless of the portfolio type in order to not hold all of your eggs in one basket.
a portfolio's standard deviation of returns (orvariance) is often used as a proxy of overall portfolio risk. the standard deviation calculation is not merely a weighted average of the individual assets' standard deviations - it must also account for thecovarianceamong the different holdings. for a 2-asset portfolio, the standard deviation calculation is:
σp= (w12σ12+ w22σ22+ 2w1w2cov1,2)1/2
a portfolio is a cornerstone of investing in the markets. a portfolio is comprised of the various positions in stocks, bonds, and other assets held, and is viewed as one cohesive unit. the portfolio components, therefore, must work together to serve the investor's financial goals, constrained by their risk tolerance and time horizon. portfolios can be constructed to achieve various strategies, from index replication to income generation to capital preservation. regardless of the strategy, diversification is seen as a good way to reduce risk without sacrificing the portfolio's expected return.

d482006a-f91f-552c-a07b-4fc060445fa3,Investopedia,Investing Basics,"What are Financial Securities? Examples, Types, Regulation, and Importance",,,Will KentonGordon ScottAmanda Bellucco-Chatham,"the term ""security"" refers to afungible, negotiablefinancial instrumentthat holds some type of monetary value. a security can represent ownership in a corporation in the form of stock, a creditor relationship with a governmental body or a corporation represented by owning that entity's bond; or rights to ownership as represented by anoption.
thesecurities act of 1933is the first federal legislation to regulate the u.s. stock market, an authority that was previously regulated at the state level. under the law, anyone who wishes to sell investment contracts to the public must publish certain information regarding the proposed offering, the company making the offering, and the principal figures of that company.
these requirements are intended to protect the investing public from deceptive or misleading marketing practices. the company and its leading figures are strictly liable for any inaccuracy in its financial statements, whether intentional or not. later legislation created thesecurities and exchange commission(sec), which is responsible for regulations and enforcement.
although the term ""securities"" is commonly associated with stocks, bonds, and similar instruments, the u.s. supreme court gives the term a much broader interpretation. in the case of howey vs. sec (1946), the court found that the plaintiff's sale of land and agricultural services constituted an ""investment contract""—even though there was no trace of a stock or bond.
this case established the four-pronghowey test, which states that an investment can be regulated as a security if:
under this rule, it does not matter if a securities offering is formalized with a legal contract or stock certificates; any type of investment offering can be a security. on several occasions, courts have enforced securities provisions on unconventional assets such as whiskey, beavers, and chinchillas.in recent years, the sec has also sought enforcement against issuers ofcryptocurrenciesandnon-fungible tokens.
securities can be broadly categorized into two distinct types:equitiesanddebts. however, some hybrid securities combine elements of both equities and debts.
an equity security represents ownership interest held by shareholders in an entity (a company, partnership, or trust), realized in the form of shares ofcapital stock, which includes shares of both common and preferred stock.
holders of equity securities are typically not entitled to regular payments—although equity securities often do pay out dividends—but they are able to profit fromcapital gainswhen they sell the securities (assuming they've increased in value).
equity securities do entitle the holder to some control of the company on apro rata basis, viavoting rights. in the case of bankruptcy, they share only in residual interest after all obligations have been paid out to creditors. they are sometimes offered aspayment-in-kind.
a debt security represents borrowed money that must be repaid, with terms that stipulate the size of the loan, interest rate, andmaturityor renewal date.
debt securities, which include government and corporate bonds, certificates of deposit (cds), and collateralized securities (such ascdos​ andcmos​), generally entitle their holder to the regular payment of interest and repayment of principal (regardless of the issuer's performance), along with any other stipulated contractual rights (which do not include voting rights).
they are typically issued for a fixed term, at the end of which they can be redeemed by the issuer. debt securities can be secured (backed by collateral) or unsecured, and, if secured, may be contractually prioritized over other unsecured,subordinated debtin the case of a bankruptcy.
hybrid securities, as the name suggests, combine some of the characteristics of both debt and equity securities. examples of hybrid securities includeequity warrants(options issued by the company itself that give shareholders the right to purchase stock within a certain timeframe and at a specific price),convertible bonds(bonds that can be converted into shares of common stock in the issuing company), andpreference shares(company stocks whose payments of interest, dividends, or other returns of capital can be prioritized over those of other stockholders).
although the preferred stock is technically classified as equity security, it is often treated as debt security because it ""behaves like a bond."" preferred shares offer a fixed dividend rate and are a popular instrument for income-seeking investors. it is essentially fixed-income security.
a derivative is a type of financial contract whose price is determined by the value of some underlying asset, such as a stock, bond, or commodity. among the most commonly traded derivatives arecall options, which gain value if the underlying asset appreciates, andput options, which gain value when the underlying asset loses value.
anasset-backed securityrepresents a part of a large basket of similar assets, such as loans, leases, credit card debts, mortgages, or anything else that generates income. over time, the cash flow from these assets is pooled and distributed among the different investors.
publicly traded securities are listed onstock exchanges, where issuers can seek security listings and attract investors by ensuring a liquid and regulated market in which to trade. informal electronic trading systems have become more common in recent years, and securities are now often traded ""over-the-counter,"" or directly among investors either online or over the phone.
an initial public offering (ipo) represents a company's first major sale of equity securities to the public. following an ipo, any newly issued stock, while still sold in theprimary market, is referred to as asecondary offering. alternatively, securities may be offered privately to a restricted and qualified group in what is known as aprivate placement—an important distinction in terms of both company law and securities regulation. sometimes companies sell stock in a combination of a public and private placement.
in thesecondary market, also known as the aftermarket, securities are simply transferred asassetsfrom one investor to another: shareholders can sell their securities to other investors for cash and/or capital gain. the secondary market thus supplements the primary. the secondary market is less liquid for privately placed securities since they are not publicly tradable and can only be transferred among qualified investors.
the entity that creates the securities for sale is known as the issuer, and those who buy them are, of course, investors. generally, securities represent an investment and a means by which municipalities, companies, and other commercial enterprises can raise new capital. companies can generate a lot of money when they go public, selling stock in an initial public offering (ipo), for example.
city, state, or county governments can raise funds for a particular project by floating amunicipal bondissue. depending on an institution's market demand or pricing structure, raising capital through securities can be a preferred alternative tofinancingthrough a bank loan.
on the other hand, purchasing securities with borrowed money, an act known asbuying on a marginis a popular investment technique. in essence, a company may deliver property rights, in the form of cash or other securities, either at inception or in default, to pay its debt or other obligation to another entity. thesecollateralarrangements have been growing of late, especially amonginstitutional investors.
in the united states, theu.s. securities and exchange commission(sec) regulates the public offer and sale of securities.
public offerings, sales, and trades of u.s. securities must be registered and filed with the sec's state securities departments.self regulatory organizations(sros) within thebrokerageindustry often take on regulatory positions as well. examples of sros include thenational association of securities dealers(nasd), and thefinancial industry regulatory authority(finra).
the definition of a security offering was established by the supreme court in a 1946 case. in its judgment, the court derives the definition of a security based on four criteria—the existence of an investment contract, the formation of a common enterprise, a promise of profits by the issuer, and use of a third party to promote the offering.
residual securities are a type ofconvertible security—that is, they can be changed into another form, usually that of common stock. a convertible bond, for example, is a residual security because it allows the bondholder to convert the security into common shares. preferred stock may also have a convertible feature. corporations may offer residual securities to attract investment capital when competition for funds is intense.
when residual security is converted or exercised, it increases the number of current outstanding common shares. this can dilute the total share pool and their price also.dilutionalso affects financial analysis metrics, such asearnings per share, because a company's earnings have to be divided by a greater number of shares.
in contrast, if a publicly traded company takes measures to reduce the total number of its outstanding shares, the company is said to haveconsolidatedthem. the net effect of this action is to increase the value of each individual share. this is often done to attract more or larger investors, such as mutual funds.
certificated securitiesare those represented in physical, paper form. securities may also be held in the direct registration system, which records shares of stock in book-entry form. in other words, a transfer agent maintains the shares on the company's behalf without the need for physical certificates.
modern technologies and policies have, in most cases, eliminated the need for certificates and for the issuer to maintain a complete security register. a system has developed wherein issuers can deposit a single global certificate representing all outstanding securities into a universal depository known as thedepository trust company(dtc). all securities traded through dtc are held in electronic form. it is important to note that certificated and un-certificated securities do not differ in terms of the rights or privileges of the shareholder or issuer.
bearer securitiesare those that are negotiable and entitle the shareholder to the rights under the security. they are transferred from investor to investor, in certain cases by endorsement and delivery. in terms of proprietary nature, pre-electronic bearer securities were always divided, meaning each security constituted a separate asset, legally distinct from others in the same issue.
depending on market practice, divided security assets can be fungible or (less commonly) non-fungible, meaning that upon lending, the borrower can return assets equivalent either to the original asset or to a specific identical asset at the end of the loan. in some cases, bearer securities may be used to aid tax evasion, and thus can sometimes be viewed negatively by issuers, shareholders, and fiscal regulatory bodies alike. they are rare in the united states.
registered securitiesbear the name of the holder and other necessary details maintained in a register by the issuer. transfers of registered securities occur through amendments to the register. registered debt securities are always undivided, meaning the entire issue makes up one single asset, with each security being a part of the whole. undivided securities are fungible by nature. secondary market shares are also always undivided.
letter securities are not registered with the sec and cannot be sold publicly in the marketplace. letter security—also known asrestricted security, letter stock, or letter bond—is sold directly by the issuer to the investor. the term is derived from the sec requirement for an ""investment letter"" from the purchaser, stating that the purchase is for investment purposes and is not intended for resale. when changing hands, these letters often require asec form 4.
cabinet securities are listed under a major financial exchange, such as thenyse, but are not actively traded. held by an inactive investment crowd, they are more likely to be a bond than a stock. the ""cabinet"" refers to the physical place where bond orders were historically stored off of the trading floor. the cabinets would typically hold limit orders, and the orders were kept on hand until they expired or were executed.
consider the case of xyz, a successful startup interested in raising capital to spur its next stage of growth. up until now, the startup's ownership has been divided between its two founders. it has a couple of options to access capital. it can tap public markets by conducting an ipo or it can raise money by offering its shares to investors in a private placement.
the former method enables the company to generate more capital, but it comes saddled with hefty fees and disclosure requirements. in the latter method, shares are traded on secondary markets and not subject to public scrutiny. both cases, however, involve the distribution of shares that dilute the stake of founders and confer ownership rights on investors. this is an example of equity security.
next, consider a government interested in raising money to revive its economy. it uses bonds or debt security to raise that amount, promising regular payments to holders of the coupon.
finally, look at the case of startup abc. it raises money from private investors, including family and friends. the startup's founders offer their investors aconvertible notethat converts into shares of the startup at a later event. most such events are funding events. the note is essentially debt security because it is a loan made by investors to the startup's founders.
at a later stage, the note turns into equity in the form of a predefined number of shares that give a slice of the company to investors. this is an example of a hybrid security.
stocks, or equity shares, are one type of security. each stock share represents fractional ownership of a public corporation, which may include the right to vote for company directors or to receive a small slice of the profits. there are many other types of securities, such as bonds, derivatives, and asset-backed securities.
amarketable securityis any type of stock, bond, or other security that can easily be bought or sold on a public exchange. for example, the shares of public companies can be traded on a stock exchange, and treasury bonds can be bought and sold on the bond market.
in contrast, anon-marketable securityis one that cannot be legally sold to the public. for example, shares in non-public companies can only be bought or sold in very limited circumstances.
treasury securities are debt securities issued by the u.s. treasury department to raise money for the government. since they are backed by the government, these bonds are considered very low-risk and highly desirable for risk-averse investors.
securities represent the most common investment contracts. when saving for retirement, most people choose to put a portion of their savings in equity or debt securities. these securities markets are also important for the market as a whole, in that they allow companies to raise capital from the public.

21c27f40-8291-5433-b13d-c205510c4f71,Investopedia,Insurance,Premium,,,Adam HayesEbony HowardSkylar Clarine,"premium has several meanings in finance. most commonly, it refers to:
broadly speaking, a premium is a price paid for above and beyond some basic orintrinsic value. relatedly, it is the price paid for protection from a loss, hazard, or harm (e.g., insurance or options contracts). the word ""premium"" is derived from the latinpraemium, where it meant ""reward"" or ""prize.""
a price that exists above some sort of fundamental value is referred to as a premium, and such assets or objects are said to be trading at a premium. assets may trade at a premium due to increased demand, limited supply, or perceptions of increased value in the future.
a premium bond is a bond trading above its face value or in other words; it costs more than the face amount on the bond. a bond might tradeat a premiumbecause its interest rate is higher than current rates in the market.
the concept of abond price premiumis related to the principle that the price of a bond is inversely related to interest rates; if a fixed-income security is purchased at a premium, this means that then-current interest rates are lower than thecoupon rateof the bond. the investor thus pays a premium for an investment that will return an amount greater than existing interest rates.
arisk premiuminvolves returns on an asset that are expected to be in excess of therisk-free rate of return. an asset's risk premium is a form of compensation for investors. it represents payment to investors for tolerating the extra risk in a given investment over that of arisk-free asset.
similarly, theequity risk premiumrefers to an excess return that investing in thestock marketprovides over a risk-free rate. this excessreturncompensates investors for taking on the relatively higher risk of equity investing. the size of the premium varies and depends on thelevel of riskin a particular portfolio. it also changes over time as market risk fluctuates.
premiums for options are the cost to buy an option. options give the holder (owner) the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying financial instrument at a specified strike price. the premium for a bond reflects changes in interest rates or risk profile since the issuance date. the buyer of an option has the right but not the obligation to buy (call) or sell (put) the underlying instrument at a given strike price for a given period of time.
the premium that is paid is its intrinsic value plus itstime value; an option with a longer maturity always costs more than the same structure with a shorter maturity. thevolatilityof the market and how close the strike price is to the then-current market price also affect the premium.
sophisticated investors sometimes sell one option (also known as writing an option) and use the premium received to cover the cost of buying the underlying instrument or another option. buying multiple options can either increase or reduce the risk profile of the position, depending on how it is structured.
premiums for insurance include the compensation the insurer receives for bearing the risk of apayoutshould an event occur that triggers coverage. the premium may also contain a sales agent's or broker's commissions. the most common types of coverage are auto, health, and homeowners insurance.
premiums are paid for many types of insurance, including health, homeowners, and rental insurance. a common example of aninsurance premiumcomes fromauto insurance. a vehicle owner can insure the value of their vehicle against loss resulting from accident, theft, fire, and other potential problems.
the owner usually pays a fixed premium amount in exchange for the insurance company's guarantee to cover anyeconomic lossesincurred under the scope of the agreement. premiums are based on both the risk associated with the insured and the amount of coverage desired.
to pay a premium generally means to pay above the going rate for something, because of some perceived added value or due to supply and demand imbalances. to pay a premium may also refer more narrowly to making payments for an insurance policy or options contract.
synonyms for ""premium"" include prize, fee, dividend, or bonus. in insurance and options trading, it may be synonymous with ""price.""
premium pricing is a marketing strategy that involves tactically setting the price of a particular product higher than either a more basic version of that product or versus the competition. the purpose of premium pricing is to convey higher quality or desirability than other options.

a0bff21a-f410-560d-b98b-36307373dbaa,Investopedia,Options and Derivatives,"Put Option: What It Is, How It Works, and How to Trade Them",,,James ChenSamantha SilbersteinAriel Courage,"a put option (or “put”) is a contract giving the option buyer the right, but not the obligation, to sell—or sell short—a specified amount of anunderlying securityat a predetermined price within a specified time frame. this predetermined price at which the buyer of the put option can sell the underlying security is called thestrike price.
put options are traded on various underlying assets, including stocks, currencies, bonds, commodities, futures, and indexes. a put option can be contrasted with acall option, which gives the holder the right to buy the underlying security at a specified price, either on or before the expiration date of the option contract.
a put option becomes more valuable as the price of the underlying stock or security decreases. conversely, a put option loses its value as the price of the underlying stock increases. as a result, they are typically used for hedging purposes or to speculate on downside price action.
investors often use put options in a risk management strategy known as aprotective put, which is used as a form of investment insurance or hedge to ensure that losses in the underlying asset do not exceed a certain amount. in this strategy, the investor buys a put option to hedge downside risk in a stock held in the portfolio. if and when the option is exercised, the investor would sell the stock at the put’s strike price. if the investor does not hold the underlying stock and exercises a put option, this would create a short position in the stock.
in general, the value of a put option decreases as its time to expiration approaches because of the impact of time decay. time decay accelerates as an option’s time to expiration draws closer since there’s less time to realize a profit from the trade. when an option loses its time value, theintrinsic valueis left over. an option’s intrinsic value is equivalent to the difference between the strike price and the underlying stock price. if an option has intrinsic value, it is referred to asin the money(itm).
option intrinsic value = difference between market price of underlying security and option strike price (for put option, iv = strike priceminusmarket priceof underlying security; for call option, iv = market price of underlying securityminusstrike price)
out of the money(otm) andat the money(atm) put options have no intrinsic value because there is no benefit in exercising the option. investors have the option of short-selling the stock at the current higher market price, rather than exercising an out-of-the-money put option at an undesirable strike price. however, outside of abear market, short selling is typicallyriskier than buying put options.
time value, or extrinsic value, is reflected in thepremiumof the option. if the strike price of a put option is $20, and the underlying is stock is currently trading at $19, there is $1 of intrinsic value in the option. but the put option may trade for $1.35. the extra $0.35 is time value, since the underlying stock price could change before the option expires. different put options on the same underlying asset may be combined to formput spreads.
there are several factors to keep in mind when it comes to selling put options. it’s important to understand an option contract’s value and profitability when considering a trade, or else you risk the stock falling past the point of profitability.
the payoff of a put option at expiration is depicted in the image below:
put options, as well as many other types of options, are traded through brokerages. some brokers have specialized features and benefits for options traders. for those who have an interest in options trading, there are manybrokers that specialize in options trading. it’s important to identify a broker that is a good match for your investment needs.
the buyer of a put option does not need to hold an option until expiration. as the underlying stock price moves, the premium of the option will change to reflect the recent underlying price movements. the option buyer can sell their option and either minimize loss or realize a profit, depending on how the price of the option has changed since they bought it.
similarly, the option writer can do the same thing. if the underlying price is above the strike price, they may do nothing. this is because the option may expire at no value, and this allows them to keep the whole premium. but if the underlying price is approaching or dropping below the strike price, then to avoid a big loss, the option writer may simply buy the option back (which gets them out of the position). the profit or loss is the difference between the premium collected and the premium paid to get out of the position.
assume an investor buys one put option on thespdr s&p 500 etf (spy), which was trading at $445 (january 2022), with a strike price of $425 expiring in one month. for this option, they paid a premium of $2.80, or $280 ($2.80 × 100 shares or units).
if units of spy fall to $415 prior to expiration, the $425 put will be “in the money” and will trade at a minimum of $10, which is the put option’s intrinsic value (i.e., $425 - $415). the exact price for the put would depend on a number of factors, the most important of which is the time remaining to expiration. assume that the $425 put is trading at $10.50.
since the put option is now “in the money,” the investor has to decide whether to (a) exercise the option, which would confer the right to sell 100 shares of spy at the strike price of $425; or (b) sell the put option and pocket the profit. we consider two cases: (i) the investor already holds 100 units of spy; and (ii) the investor does not hold any spy units. (the calculations below ignore commission costs, to keep things simple).
let’s say the investorexercisesthe put option. if the investor already holds 100 units of spy (assume they were purchased at $400) in their portfolio and the put was bought to hedge downside risk (i.e., it was a protective put), then the investor’s broker would sell the 100 spy shares at the strike price of $425.
the net profit on this trade can be calculated as:
[(spy sell price - spy purchase price) - (put purchase price)] × number of shares or units
profit = [($425 - $400) - $2.80)] × 100 = $2,220
what if the investor did not own the spy units, and the put option was purchased purely as a speculative trade? in this case, exercising the put option would result in a short sale of 100 spy units at the $425 strike price. the investor could then buy back the 100 spy units at the current market price of $415 to close out the short position.
the net profit on this trade can be calculated as:
[(spy short sell price - spy purchase price) - (put purchase price)] × number of shares or units
profit = [($425 - $415) - $2.80)] × 100 = $720
exercising the option, (short) selling the shares and then buying them back sounds like a fairly complicated endeavor, not to mention added costs in the form of commissions (since there are multiple transactions) and margin interest (for the short sale). but the investor actually has an easier “option” (for lack of a better word): simply sell the put option at its current price and make a tidy profit. the profit calculation in this case is:
[put sell price - put purchase price] × number of shares or units = [10.50 - $2.80] × 100 = $770
there’s a key point to note here. selling the option, rather than going through the relatively convoluted process of option exercise, actually results in a profit of $770, which is $50 more than the $720 made by exercising the option. why the difference? because selling the option enables the time value of $0.50 per share ($0.50 × 100 shares = $50) to be captured as well. thus, most long option positions that have value prior to expiration are sold rather than exercised.
for a put option buyer, the maximum loss on the option position is limited to the premium paid for the put. the maximum gain on the option position would occur if the underlying stock price fell to zero.
the majority of long option positions that have value prior to expiration are closed out byselling rather than exercising, since exercising an option will result in loss of time value, higher transaction costs, and additional margin requirements.
in the previous section, we discussed put options from the perspective of the buyer, or an investor who has a long put position. we now turn our attention to the other side of the option trade: the put option seller or the put option writer, who has a short put position.
contrary to a long put option, a short or written put option obligates an investor to take delivery, or purchase shares, of the underlying stock at the strike price specified in the option contract.
assume an investor is bullish on spy, which is currently trading at $445, and does not believe it will fall below $430 over the next month. the investor could collect a premium of $3.45 per share (× 100 shares, or $345) by writing one put option on spy with a strike price of $430.
if spy stays above the $430 strike price over the next month, the investor would keep the premium collected ($345) since the options would expire out of the money and be worthless. this is the maximum profit on the trade: $345, or the premium collected.
conversely, if spy moves below $430 before option expiration in one month, the investor is on the hook for purchasing 100 shares at $430, even if spy falls to $400, or $350, or even lower. no matter how far the stock falls, the put option writer is liable for purchasing the shares at the strike price of $430, meaning they face a theoretical risk of $430 per share, or $43,000 per contract ($430 × 100 shares) if the underlying stock falls to zero.
for a put writer, the maximum gain is limited to the premium collected, while the maximum loss would occur if the underlying stock price fell to zero. the gain/loss profiles for the put buyer and put writer are thus diametrically opposite.
buying puts and short selling are both bearish strategies, but there are some important differences between the two. a put buyer’s maximum loss is limited to the premium paid for the put, while buying puts does not require a margin account and can be done with limited amounts of capital. short selling, on the other hand, has theoretically unlimited risk and is significantly more expensive because of costs such as stock borrowing charges and margin interest (short selling generally needs a margin account). short selling is therefore considered to be much riskier than buying puts.
it really depends on factors such as your trading objective, risk appetite, amount of capital, etc. the dollar outlay for in the money (itm) puts is higher than for out of the money (otm) puts because they give you the right to sell the underlying security at a higher price. but the lower price for otm puts is offset by the fact that they also have a lower probability of being profitable by expiration. if you don’t want to spend too much for protective puts and are willing to accept the risk of a modest decline in your portfolio, then otm puts might be the way to go.
yes, you can lose the entire amount of premium paid for your put, if the price of the underlying security does not trade below the strike price by option expiry.
put writing is an advanced option strategy meant for experienced traders and investors; strategies such as writing cash-secured puts also need a significant amount of capital. if you’re new to options and have limited capital, put writing would be a risky endeavor and not a recommended one.
put options allow the holder to sell a security at a guaranteed price, even if the market price for that security has fallen lower. that makes them useful for hedging strategies, as well as for speculative traders. along with call options, puts are among the most basic derivative contracts.

f4ee4a41-e64a-50a1-9609-5bcae3177d4d,Investopedia,,What Is a 401(k) and How Does It Work?,,,Jason FernandoRoger WohlnerKatrina Munichiello,"investopedia / ellen lindner
a 401(k) plan is a retirement savings plan offered by many american employers that has tax advantages for the saver. it is named after a section of the u.s.internal revenue code (irc).
the employee who signs up for a 401(k) agrees to have a percentage of each paycheck paid directly into an investment account. the employer may match part or all of that contribution. the employee gets to choose among a number of investment options, usually mutual funds.
the 401(k) plan was designed by the united states congress to encourage americans to save for retirement. among the benefits they offer is tax savings.
there are two main options, each with distinct tax advantages.
with a traditional 401(k), employee contributions are deducted fromgross income, meaning the money comes from the employee's payroll before income taxes have been deducted. as a result, the employee'staxable incomeis reduced by the total amount of contributions for the year and can be reported as atax deductionfor that tax year. no taxes are due on the money contributed or theinvestment earningsuntil the employee withdraws the money, usually in retirement.
with aroth 401(k), contributions are deducted from the employee's after-tax income, meaning contributions come from the employee's pay after income taxes have been deducted. as a result, there is no tax deduction in the year of the contribution. when the money is withdrawn during retirement, no additional taxes are due on the employee's contribution or the investment earnings.
however, not all employers offer the option of a roth account. if the roth is offered, the employee can pick one or the other or a mix of both, up to annual limits on their tax-deductible contributions.
a 401(k) is adefined contribution plan. the employee and employer can make contributions to the account up to the dollar limits set by the internal revenue service (irs).
a defined contribution plan is an alternative to the traditionalpension, known in irs lingo as adefined-benefit plan. with a pension, the employer is committed to providing a specific amount of money to the employee for life during retirement.
in recent decades, 401(k) plans have become more common, and traditional pensions have become rare as employers shifted the responsibility and risk of saving for retirement to their employees.
employees also are responsible for choosing the specific investments within their 401(k) accounts from a selection their employer offers. those offerings typically include an assortment of stock and bondmutual fundsand target-date funds designed to reduce the risk of investment losses as the employee approaches retirement.
they may also includeguaranteed investment contracts (gics)issued by insurance companies and sometimesthe employer's own stock.
the maximum amount that an employee or employer can contribute to a 401(k) plan is adjusted periodically to account forinflation, which is a metric that measures rising prices in an economy.
for 2022, the annual limit on employee contributions is $20,500 per year for workers under age 50. however, those aged 50 and over can make a $6,500 catch-up contribution in 2022.
if the employer also contributes or if the employee elects to make additional, non-deductibleafter-tax contributionsto their traditional 401(k) account, there is a total employee-and-employer contribution amount for the year.
2022
employers who match their employee contributions use various formulas to calculate that match.
for instance, an employer might match 50 cents for every dollar the employee contributes up to a certain percentage of salary.
financial advisorsoften recommend that employees contribute at least enough money to their 401(k) plans to get the full employer match.
if their employer offers both types of 401(k) plans, employees can split their contributions, putting some money into a traditional 401(k) and some into a roth 401(k).
however, their total contribution to the two types of accounts can't exceed the limit for one account (such as $20,500 for those under age 50 in 2022).
employer contributions can only go into a traditional 401(k) account where they will be subject to tax upon withdrawal, not into a roth.
your contributions to your 401(k) account are invested according to the choices you make from the selection your employer offers. as noted above, these options typically include an assortment of stock and bondmutual fundsand target-date funds designed to reduce the risk of investment losses as you get closer to retirement.
how much money you contribute each year, whether or not your company matches your contribution, how your contributions are invested and the annual rate of return on those investments, and the number of years you have until retirement all contribute to how quickly and how much your money will grow. and provided you don't remove funds from your account, you don't have to pay taxes on investment gains, interest, or dividends until you withdraw money from the account after retirement (unless you have a roth 401(k), in which case you don't have to pay taxes on qualified withdrawals when you retire).
what's more, if you open a 401(k) when you are young, it has the potential to earn more money for you, thanks to the power ofcompounding. the benefit of compounding is that returns generated by savings can be reinvested back into the account and begin generating returns of their own. over a period of many years, the compounded earnings on your 401(k) account can actually be larger than the contributions you have made to the account. in this way, as you keep contributing to your 401(k), it has the potential to grow into a sizable chunk of money over time.
once money goes into a 401(k), it is difficult to withdraw it without paying taxes on the withdrawal amounts.
""make sure that you still save enough on the outside for emergencies and expenses you may have before retirement,"" says dan stewart, cfa®, president of revere asset management inc., in dallas.""do not put all of your savings into your 401(k) where you cannot easily access it, if necessary.""
the earnings in a 401(k) account aretax-deferredin the case of traditional 401(k)s and tax-free in the case of roths. when the traditional 401(k) owner makes withdrawals, that money (which has never been taxed) will be taxed asordinary income. roth account owners have already paid income tax on the money they contributed to the plan and will owe no tax on their withdrawals as long as they satisfycertain requirements.
both traditional and roth 401(k) owners must be at least age 59½—or meet other criteriaspelled out by the irs, such as being totally and permanently disabled—when they start to make withdrawals.
otherwise, they usually will face an additional 10% early distribution penalty tax on top of any other tax they owe.
some employers allow employees to take out aloanagainst their contributions to a 401(k) plan. the employee is essentially borrowing from themselves. if you take out a 401(k) loan, please consider that if you leave the job before the loan is repaid, you'll have to repay it in a lump sum or face the 10% penalty for an early withdrawal.
traditional 401(k) account holders are subject torequired minimum distributions (rmds)after reaching a certain age. (withdrawals are often referred to as distributions in irs parlance.)
after age 72, account owners who have retired must withdraw at least a specified percentage from their 401(k) plans using irs tables based on their life expectancy at the time. (prior to 2020, the rmd age was 70½ years old.)
note that distributions from a traditional 401(k) are taxable.qualified withdrawals from a roth 401(k) are not.
roth iras, unlike roth 401(k)s, are not subject to rmds during the owner's lifetime.
when 401(k) plans became available in 1978, companies and their employees had just one choice: the traditional 401(k).then in 2006, roth 401(k)s arrived. roths are named for former u.s. senator william roth of delaware, the primary sponsor of the 1997 legislation that made the roth ira possible.
while roth 401(k)s were a little slow to catch on, many employers now offer them. so the first decision employees often have to make is between aroth and a traditional (40l(k).
as a general rule, employees who expect to be in a lowermarginal tax bracketafter they retire might want to opt for a traditional 401(k) and take advantage of the immediate tax break.
on the other hand, employees who expect to be in a higher bracket after retiring might opt for the roth so that they can avoid taxes on their savings later. also important—especially if the roth has years to grow—is that there is no tax on withdrawals, which means that all the money the contributions earn over decades of being in the account is tax-free.
as a practical matter, the roth reduces your immediate spending power more than a traditional 401(k) plan. that matters if your budget is tight.
since no one can predict what tax rates will be decades from now, neither type of 401(k) is a sure thing. for that reason, many financial advisors suggest that people hedge their bets, putting some of their money into each.
when you leave a company where you've been employed and you have a 401(k) plan,you generally have four options:
withdrawing the money is usually a bad idea unless you urgently need the cash. the money will be taxable in the year it's withdrawn. you will be hit with the additional 10% early distribution tax unless you are over 59½, permanently disabled, or meet the other irs criteria for an exception to the rule.
this rule was suspended for 2020 for those affected by the 2020 covid-19 economic crisis.
in the case of roth iras, you can withdraw your contributions (but not any profits) tax-free and without penalty at any time as long as you have had the account for at least five years. remember, however, that you're still diminishing your retirement savings, which you may regret later.
by moving the money into an ira at a brokerage firm, a mutual fund company, or a bank, you can avoid immediate taxes and maintain the account's tax-advantaged status. what's more, you will be able to select among a wider range of investment choices than with your employer's plan.
the irs has relativelystrict rules on rolloversand how they need to be accomplished, and running afoul of them is costly. typically, the financial institution that is in line to receive the money will be more than happy to help with the process and avoid any missteps.
funds withdrawn from your 401(k) must be rolled over to another retirement account within 60 days to avoid taxes and penalties.
in many cases, employers will permit a departing employee to keep a 401(k) account in their old plan indefinitely, though the employee can't make any further contributions to it. this generally applies to accounts worth at least $5,000. in the case of smaller accounts, the employer may give the employee no choice but to move the money elsewhere.
leaving 401(k) money where it is can make sense if the old employer's plan is well managed and you are satisfied with the investment choices it offers. the danger is that employees who change jobs over the course of their careers can leave a trail of old 401(k) plans and may forget about one or more of them. their heirs might also be unaware of the existence of the accounts.
you can usually move your 401(k) balance to your new employer's plan. as with an ira rollover, this maintains the account's tax-deferred status and avoids immediate taxes.
it could be a wise move if you aren't comfortable with making the investment decisions involved in managing a rollover ira and would rather leave some of that work to the new plan's administrator.
the simplest way to start a 401(k) plan is through your employer. many companies offer 401(k) plans and some will match part of an employee's contributions. in this case, your 401(k) paperwork and payments will be handled by the company during onboarding. if you are self-employed or run a small business with your spouse, you may be eligible for asolo 401(k) plan, also known as an independent 401(k).
these retirement plans allow freelancers and independent contractors to fund their own retirement, even though they are not employed by another company. a solo 401(k) can be created through most online brokers.
for most people, the maximum contribution to a 401(k) plan is $20,500 in 2022. if you are more than 50 years old, you can make an additional catch-up contribution of $6,500 for a total of $27,000. there are also limitations to the employer's matching contribution: the combined employer-employee contributions cannot exceed $61,000 (or $67,500 for employees over 50 years old).
there are few advantages to taking an early withdrawal from a 401(k) plan. if you take withdrawals before age 59½, you will face an additional 10% penalty in addition to any taxes you owe. however, some employers allowhardship withdrawalsfor sudden financial needs, such as medical costs, funeral costs, or buying a home. this can help you skip the early withdrawal penalty but you will still have to pay taxes on the withdrawal.
a 401(k) plan lets you reduce your tax burden while saving for retirement. not only are the gains tax-free but it's also hassle-free since contributions are automatically subtracted from your paycheck. in addition, many employers will match part of their employee's 401(k) contributions, effectively giving them a free boost to their retirement savings.

quantifiably, risk is usually assessed by considering historical behaviors and outcomes. in finance, standard deviation is a common metric associated with risk.standard deviationprovides a measure of the volatility of asset prices in comparison to their historical averages in a given time frame.
overall, it is possible and prudent to manageinvesting risksby understanding the basics of risk and how it is measured. learning the risks that can apply to different scenarios and some of the ways to manage them holistically will help all types of investors and business managers to avoid unnecessary and costly losses.
everyone is exposed to some type of risk every day—whether it’s from driving, walking down the street, investing, capital planning, or something else. an investor’s personality, lifestyle, and age are some of the top factors to consider for individual investment management and risk purposes. each investor has a uniquerisk profilethat determines their willingness and ability to withstand risk. in general, as investment risks rise, investors expect higher returns to compensate for taking those risks.
a fundamental idea in finance is the relationship between risk and return. the greater the amount of risk an investor is willing to take, the greater the potential return. risks can come in various ways and investors need to be compensated for taking on additional risk. for example, a u.s.treasury bondis considered one of the safest investments and when compared to acorporate bond, provides a lower rate of return. a corporation is much more likely to go bankrupt than the u.s. government. because the default risk of investing in a corporate bond is higher, investors are offered a higher rate of return.
quantifiably, risk is usually assessed by considering historical behaviors and outcomes. in finance, standard deviation is a common metric associated with risk. standard deviation provides a measure of the volatility of a value in comparison to its historical average. a high standard deviation indicates a lot of value volatility and therefore a high degree of risk.
individuals, financial advisors, and companies can all developrisk managementstrategies to help manage risks associated with their investments and business activities. academically, there are several theories, metrics, and strategies that have been identified to measure, analyze, and manage risks. some of these include: standard deviation, beta, value at risk (var), and the capital asset pricing model (capm). measuring and quantifying risk often allows investors, traders, and business managers to hedge some risks away by using various strategies including diversification and derivative positions.
while it is true that no investment is fully free of all possible risks, certain securities have so little practical risk that they are considered risk-free or riskless.
riskless securities often form a baseline for analyzing and measuring risk. these types of investments offer an expected rate of return with very little or no risk. oftentimes, all types of investors will look to these securities for preserving emergency savings or forholding assetsthat need to be immediately accessible.
examples of riskless investments and securities includecertificates of deposits (cds), government money market accounts, and u.s. treasury bills. the 30-day u.s. treasury bill is generally viewed as the baseline, risk-free security for financial modeling. it is backed by the full faith and credit of the u.s. government, and, given its relatively short maturity date, has minimal interest rate exposure.
time horizon and liquidity of investments is often a key factor influencing risk assessment and risk management. if an investor needs funds to be immediately accessible, they are less likely to invest in high risk investments or investments that cannot be immediately liquidated and more likely to place their money in riskless securities.
time horizons will also be an important factor for individual investment portfolios. younger investors with longer time horizons to retirement may be willing to invest in higher risk investments with higher potential returns. older investors would have a different risk tolerance since they will need funds to be more readily available.
morningstar is one of the premier objective agencies that affixes risk ratings to mutual funds andexchange-traded funds (etfs).an investor can match a portfolio’s risk profile with their own appetite for risk.
every saving and investment action involves different risks and returns. in general, financial theory classifies investment risks affecting asset values into two categories:systematic riskandunsystematic risk. broadly speaking, investors are exposed to both systematic and unsystematic risks.
systematic risks, also known as market risks, are risks that can affect an entire economic market overall or a large percentage of the total market. market risk is the risk of losing investments due to factors, such as political risk and macroeconomic risk, that affect the performance of the overall market. market risk cannot be easily mitigated through portfolio diversification. other common types of systematic risk can include interest rate risk, inflation risk, currency risk, liquidity risk, country risk, and sociopolitical risk.
unsystematic risk, also known as specific risk or idiosyncratic risk, is a category of risk that only affects an industry or a particular company. unsystematic risk is the risk of losing an investment due to company or industry-specific hazard. examples include a change in management, a product recall, a regulatory change that could drive down company sales, and a new competitor in the marketplace with the potential to take away market share from a company.investors often use diversification to manage unsystematic risk by investing in a variety of assets.
in addition to the broad systematic and unsystematic risks, there are several specific types of risk, including:
business riskrefers to the basic viability of a business—the question of whether a company will be able to make sufficient sales and generate sufficient revenues to cover its operational expenses and turn a profit. while financial risk is concerned with the costs of financing, business risk is concerned with all the other expenses a business must cover to remain operational and functioning.these expenses include salaries, production costs, facility rent, office, and administrative expenses. the level of a company's business risk is influenced by factors such as the cost of goods, profit margins, competition, and the overall level of demand for the products or services that it sells.
credit riskis the risk that a borrower will be unable to pay the contractual interest or principal on its debt obligations.this type of risk is particularly concerning to investors who hold bonds in their portfolios.government bonds, especially those issued by the federal government, have the least amount of default risk and, as such, the lowest returns. corporate bonds, on the other hand, tend to have the highest amount of default risk, but also higher interest rates. bonds with a lower chance of default are consideredinvestment grade, while bonds with higher chances are considered high yield orjunk bonds. investors can usebond rating agencies—such as standard and poor’s, fitch and moody's—to determine which bonds are investment-grade and which are junk.
country riskrefers to the risk that a country won't be able to honor its financial commitments.when a countrydefaultson its obligations, it can harm the performance of all other financial instruments in that country—as well as other countries it has relations with. country risk applies to stocks, bonds, mutual funds, options, and futures that are issued within a particular country. this type of risk is most often seen inemerging marketsor countries that have a severe deficit.
when investing in foreign countries, it’s important to consider the fact that currency exchange rates can change the price of the asset as well.foreign exchange risk(or exchange rate risk) applies to all financial instruments that are in a currency other than your domestic currency.as an example, if you live in the u.s. and invest in a canadian stock in canadian dollars, even if the share value appreciates, you may lose money if the canadian dollar depreciates in relation to the u.s. dollar.
interest rate riskis the risk that an investment's value will change due to a change in the absolute level of interest rates, the spread between two rates, in the shape of the yield curve, or in any other interest rate relationship. this type of risk affects the value of bonds more directly than stocks and is a significant risk to all bondholders.as interest rates rise, bond prices in the secondary market fall—and vice versa.
political riskis the risk an investment’s returns could suffer because of political instability or changes in a country. this type of risk can stem from a change in government, legislative bodies, other foreign policy makers, or military control.also known as geopolitical risk, the risk becomes more of a factor as an investment’s time horizon gets longer.
counterparty risk is the likelihood or probability that one of those involved in a transaction might default on itscontractual obligation. counterparty risk can exist in credit, investment, and trading transactions, especially for those occurring in over-the-counter (otc) markets. financial investment products such as stocks, options, bonds, and derivatives carry counterparty risk.
liquidity risk is associated with an investor’s ability to transact their investment for cash.typically, investors will require some premium for illiquid assets which compensates them for holding securities over time that cannot be easily liquidated.
therisk-return tradeoffis the balance between the desire for the lowest possible risk and the highest possible returns. in general, low levels of risk are associated with low potential returns and high levels of risk are associated with high potential returns.each investor must decide how much risk they’re willing and able to accept for a desired return. this will be based on factors such as age, income, investment goals, liquidity needs, time horizon, and personality.
the following chart shows a visual representation of the risk/return tradeoff for investing, where a higher standard deviation means a higher level or risk—as well as a higher potential return.
it’s important to keep in mind that higher risk doesn’t automatically equate to higher returns. the risk-return tradeoff only indicates that higher risk investments have the possibility of higher returns—but there are no guarantees. on the lower-risk side of the spectrum is therisk-free rate of return—the theoretical rate of return of an investment with zero risk. it represents the interest you would expect from an absolutely risk-free investment over a specific period of time. in theory, the risk-free rate of return is the minimum return you would expect for any investment because you wouldn’t accept additional risk unless the potential rate of return is greater than the risk-free rate.
the most basic—and effective—strategy for minimizing risk isdiversification. diversification is based heavily on the concepts of correlation and risk.a well-diversified portfolio will consist of different types of securities from diverse industries that have varying degrees of risk and correlation with each other’s returns.
while most investment professionals agree that diversification can’t guarantee against a loss, it is the most important component to helping an investor reach long-range financial goals, while minimizing risk.
there are several ways to plan for and ensure adequate diversification including:
keep in mind that portfolio diversification is not a one-time task. investors and businesses perform regular “check-ups” or rebalancing to make sure their portfolios have a risk level that’s consistent with their financial strategy and goals.
we all face risks every day—whether we’re driving to work, surfing a 60-foot wave, investing, or managing a business. in the financial world, risk refers to the chance that an investment’s actual return will differ from what is expected—the possibility that an investment won’t do as well as you’d like, or that you’ll end up losing money.
the most effective way tomanage investing riskis through regular risk assessment and diversification. although diversification won’t ensure gains or guarantee against losses, it does provide the potential to improve returns based on your goals and target level of risk. finding the right balance between risk and return helps investors and business managers achieve their financial goals through investments that they can be most comfortable with.

690ac042-0daa-5fd9-9770-22a91af99eab,Investopedia,Options and Derivatives,"Derivatives: Types, Considerations, and Pros and Cons",,,Jason FernandoCharles PottersPete Rathburn,"the term derivative refers to a type of financial contract whose value is dependent on anunderlying asset, group of assets, or benchmark. a derivative is set between two or more parties that can trade on an exchange orover-the-counter(otc).
these contracts can be used to trade any number of assets and carry their own risks. prices for derivatives derive from fluctuations in the underlying asset. these financial securities are commonly used to access certain markets and may be traded tohedgeagainst risk. derivatives can be used to either mitigate risk (hedging) or assume risk with the expectation of commensurate reward (speculation). derivatives can move risk (and the accompanying rewards) from therisk-averseto therisk seekers.
a derivative is a complex type of financial security that is set between two or more parties. traders use derivatives to access specificmarketsand trade different assets. typically, derivatives are considered a form of advanced investing. the most common underlying assets for derivatives are stocks, bonds,commodities,currencies, interest rates, and market indexes. contract values depend on changes in the prices of the underlying asset.
derivatives can be used to hedge a position, speculate on the directional movement of an underlying asset, or give leverage to holdings. these assets are commonly traded on exchanges or otc and are purchased through brokerages. thechicago mercantile exchange(cme) is among the world's largest derivatives exchanges.
it's important to remember that when companies hedge, they're not speculating on the price of the commodity. instead, the hedge is merely a way for each party to manage risk. each party has its profit or margin built into the price, and the hedge helps to protect those profits from being eliminated by market moves in the price of the commodity.
otc-traded derivatives generally have a greater possibility ofcounterparty risk, which is the danger that one of the parties involved in the transaction mightdefault. these contracts trade between two private parties and are unregulated. to hedge this risk, the investor could purchase a currency derivative to lock in a specific exchange rate. derivatives that could be used to hedge this kind of risk includecurrency futuresandcurrency swaps.
exchange-traded derivatives are standardized and more heavily regulated than those that are traded over-the-counter.
derivatives were originally used to ensure balanced exchange rates for internationally traded goods. international traders needed a system to account for the differing values of national currencies.
assume a european investor has investment accounts that are all denominated in euros (eur). let's say they purchase shares of a u.s. company through a u.s. exchange using u.s. dollars (usd). this means they are now exposed toexchange rate riskwhile holding that stock. exchange rate risk is the threat that the value of the euro will increase in relation to the usd. if this happens, any profits the investor realizes upon selling the stock become less valuable when they are converted into euros.
aspeculatorwho expects the euro to appreciate versus the dollar could profit by using a derivative that rises in value with the euro. when using derivatives to speculate on the price movement of an underlying asset, the investor does not need to have a holding orportfoliopresence in the underlying asset.
many derivative instruments are leveraged, which means a small amount of capital is required to have an interest in a large amount of value in the underlying asset.
derivatives today are based on a wide variety oftransactionsand have many more uses. there are even derivatives based on weather data, such as the amount of rain or the number of sunny days in a region.
there are many different types of derivatives that can be used forrisk management,speculation, and leveraging a position. the derivatives market is one that continues to grow, offering products to fit nearly any need orrisk tolerance.
there are two classes of derivative products: ""lock"" and ""option."" lock products (e.g., futures, forwards, or swaps) bind the respective parties from the outset to the agreed-upon terms over the life of the contract. option products (e.g., stock options), on the other hand, offer the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset or security at a specific price on or before the option's expiration date. the most common derivative types are futures, forwards, swaps, and options.
afutures contract, or simply futures, is an agreement between two parties for the purchase and delivery of an asset at an agreed-upon price at a future date. futures are standardized contracts that trade on an exchange. traders use a futures contract to hedge their risk or speculate on the price of an underlying asset. the parties involved are obligated to fulfill a commitment to buy or sell the underlying asset.
for example, say that on nov. 6, 2021, company a buys a futures contract for oil at a price of $62.22 per barrel that expires dec. 19, 2021. the company does this because it needs oil in december and is concerned that the price will rise before the company needs to buy. buying an oil futures contract hedges the company's risk because the seller is obligated to deliver oil to company a for $62.22 per barrel once the contract expires. assume oil prices rise to $80 per barrel by dec. 19, 2021. company a can accept delivery of the oil from the seller of the futures contract, but if it no longer needs the oil, it can also sell the contract before expiration and keep the profits.
in this example, both the futures buyer and seller hedge their risk. company a needed oil in the future and wanted to offset the risk that the price may rise in december with a long position in an oil futures contract. the seller could be an oil company concerned about falling oil prices that wanted to eliminate that risk by selling orshortinga futures contract that fixed the price it would get in december.
it is also possible that one or both of the parties are speculators with the opposite opinion about the direction of december oil. in that case, one might benefit from the contract, and one might not. take, for example, the futures contract for west texas intermediate (wti) oil that trades on the cme and represents 1,000 barrels of oil. if the price of oil rose from $62.22 to $80 per barrel, the trader with the long position—the buyer—in the futures contract would have profited $17,780 [($80 - $62.22) x 1,000 = $17,780].the trader with the short position—the seller—in the contract would have a loss of $17,780.
not all futures contracts are settled at expiration by delivering the underlying asset. if both parties in a futures contract are speculating investors ortraders, it is unlikely that either of them would want to make arrangements for the delivery of a large number of barrels of crude oil. speculators can end their obligation to purchase or deliver the underlying commodity by closing (unwinding) their contract before expiration with an offsetting contract.
many derivatives are, in fact, cash-settled, which means that the gain or loss in the trade is simply an accounting cash flow to the trader's brokerage account. futures contracts that are cash-settled include many interest rate futures,stock index futures, and more unusual instruments such as volatility futures or weather futures.
forward contracts, or forwards, are similar to futures, but they do not trade on an exchange. these contracts only trade over-the-counter. when a forward contract is created, the buyer and seller may customize the terms, size, and settlement process. as otc products, forward contracts carry a greater degree of counterparty risk for both parties.
counterparty risks are a type ofcredit riskin that the parties may not be able to live up to the obligations outlined in the contract. if one party becomes insolvent, the other party may have no recourse and could lose the value of its position.
once created, the parties in a forward contract can offset their position with other counterparties, which can increase the potential for counterparty risks as more traders become involved in the same contract.
swapsare another common type of derivative, often used to exchange one kind of cash flow with another. for example, a trader might use aninterest rate swapto switch from a variable interest rate loan to a fixed interest rate loan, or vice versa.
imagine that company xyz borrows $1,000,000 and pays avariable interest rateon the loan that is currently 6%. xyz may be concerned about rising interest rates that will increase the costs of this loan or encounter a lender that is reluctant to extend more credit while the company has this variable-rate risk.
assume xyz creates a swap with company qrs, which is willing to exchange the payments owed on the variable-rate loan for the payments owed on a fixed-rate loan of 7%. that means that xyz will pay 7% to qrs on its $1,000,000 principal, and qrs will pay xyz 6% interest on the same principal. at the beginning of the swap, xyz will just pay qrs the 1 percentage-point difference between the twoswap rates.
if interest rates fall so that the variable rate on the original loan is now 5%, company xyz will have to pay company qrs the 2 percentage-point difference on the loan. if interest rates rise to 8%, then qrs would have to pay xyz the 1 percentage-point difference between the two swap rates. regardless of how interest rates change, the swap has achieved xyz's original objective of turning a variable-rate loan into afixed-rateloan.
swaps can also be constructed to exchange currency-exchange rate risk or the risk of default on a loan or cash flows from other business activities. swaps related to the cash flows and potential defaults of mortgage bonds are an extremely popular kind of derivative. in fact, they've been a bit too popular in the past. it was the counterparty risk of swaps like this that eventually spiraled into thecredit crisisof 2008.
anoptions contractis similar to a futures contract in that it is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined future date for a specific price. the key difference between options and futures is that with an option, the buyer is not obliged to exercise their agreement to buy or sell. it is an opportunity only, not an obligation, as futures are. as with futures, options may be used to hedge or speculate on the price of the underlying asset.
in terms of timing your right to buy or sell, it depends on the ""style"" of the option. an american option allows holders to exercise the option rights at any time before and including the day of expiration. a european option can be executed only on the day of expiration. most stocks and exchange-traded funds have american-style options while equity indexes, including the s&p 500, have european-style options.

imagine an investor owns 100 shares of a stock worth $50 per share. they believe the stock's value will rise in the future. however, this investor is concerned about potential risks and decides to hedge their position with an option. the investor could buy a put option that gives them the right to sell 100 shares of the underlying stock for $50 per share—known as thestrike price—until a specific day in the future—known as theexpiration date.
assume the stock falls in value to $40 per share by expiration and the put option buyer decides to exercise their option and sell the stock for the original strike price of $50 per share. if the put option cost the investor $200 to purchase, then they have only lost the cost of the option because the strike price was equal to the price of the stock when they originally bought the put. a strategy like this is called aprotective putbecause it hedges the stock's downside risk.
alternatively, assume an investor doesn't own the stock currently worth $50 per share. they believe its value will rise over the next month. this investor could buy a call option that gives them the right to buy the stock for $50 before or at expiration. assume this call option cost $200 and the stock rose to $60 before expiration. the buyer can now exercise their option and buy a stock worth $60 per share for the $50 strike price for an initial profit of $10 per share. a call option represents 100 shares, so the real profit is $1,000, less the cost of the option—thepremium—and any brokerage commission fees.
in both examples, the sellers are obligated to fulfill their side of the contract if the buyers choose to exercise the contract. however, if a stock's price is above the strike price at expiration, the put will be worthless and the seller (the option writer) gets to keep the premium as the option expires. if the stock's price is below the strike price at expiration, the call will be worthless and the call seller will keep the premium.
as the above examples illustrate, derivatives can be a useful tool for businesses and investors alike. they provide a way to do the following:
these pluses can often come for a limited cost.
derivatives also can often be purchased onmargin, which means traders use borrowed funds to purchase them. this makes them even less expensive.
derivatives are difficult to value because they are based on the price of another asset. the risks for otc derivatives include counterparty risks that are difficult to predict or value. most derivatives are also sensitive to the following:
these variables make it difficult to perfectly match the value of a derivative with the underlying asset.
because the derivative has no intrinsic value (its value comes only from the underlying asset), it is vulnerable tomarket sentimentand market risk. it is possible for supply and demand factors to cause a derivative's price and itsliquidityto rise and fall, regardless of what is happening with the price of the underlying asset.
finally, derivatives are usually leveraged instruments, and using leverage cuts both ways. while it can increase the rate of return, it also makes losses mount more quickly.

derivatives are securities whose value is dependent on or derived from an underlying asset. for example, anoil futures contractis a type of derivative whose value is based on the market price of oil. derivatives have become increasingly popular in recent decades, with thetotal value of derivatives outstandingwas estimated at $610 trillion at june 30, 2021.
common examples of derivatives include futures contracts, options contracts, andcredit default swaps. beyond these, there is a vast quantity of derivative contracts tailored to meet the needs of a diverse range of counterparties. in fact, because many derivatives are traded over-the-counter (otc), they can in principle be infinitely customized.
derivatives can be a very convenient way to achieve financial goals. for example, a company that wants to hedge against its exposure to commodities can do so by buying or selling energy derivatives such as crude oil futures. similarly, a company could hedge its currency risk by purchasing currency forward contracts. derivatives can also help investors leverage their positions, such as by buying equities through stock options rather than shares. the main drawbacks of derivatives include counterparty risk, the inherent risks of leverage, and the fact that complicated webs of derivative contracts can lead tosystemic risks.

58d7b44b-73b2-52d0-baeb-49db57beebf4,Investopedia,Options and Derivatives,What Is a Call Option and How to Use It With Example,,,Jason FernandoGordon ScottTimothy Li,"call options are financial contracts that give the option buyer the right but not the obligation to buy a stock, bond,commodity, or other asset or instrument at a specified price within a specific time period. the stock, bond, or commodity is called theunderlying asset. a call buyer profits when the underlying asset increases in price.
a call option may be contrasted with aput option, which gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset at a specified price on or before expiration.
let's assume the underlying asset is stock. call options give the holder the right to buy 100 shares of a company at a specific price, known as thestrike price(exercise price), up until a specified date, known as theexpiration date.
for example, a single call option contract may give a holder the right to buy 100 shares of apple stock at $100 up until the expiration date three months later. there are many expiration dates and strike prices that traders can choose. as the value of apple stock goes up, the price of the option contract goes up, and vice versa. the call option buyer may hold the contract until the expiration date, at which point they cantake deliveryof the 100 shares of stock, or they can sell the options contract at any point before the expiration date at the market price of the contract at that time.
you pay a fee to purchase a call option, called thepremium. it is the price paid for the rights that the call option provides. if at expiration the underlying asset is below the strike price, the call buyer loses the premium paid. this is the maximum loss.
if the underlying asset's current market price is above the strike price at expiration, the profit is the difference in prices, minus the premium. this sum is then multiplied by how many shares the option buyer controls.
for example, if apple is trading at $110 at expiry, the option contract strike price is $100, and the options cost the buyer $2 per share, the profit is $110 - ($100 +$2) = $8. if the buyer bought one options contract, their profit equates to $800 ($8 x 100 shares); the profit would be $1,600 if they bought two contracts ($8 x 200).
now, if at expiration apple is trading below $100, obviously the buyer won't exercise the option to buy the shares at $100 apiece, and the option expires worthless. the buyer loses $2 per share, or $200, for each contract they bought—but that's all. that's the beauty of options: you're only out the premium if you decide not to play.

there are two basic ways to trade call options.
call option payoff refers to the profit or loss that an option buyer or seller makes from a trade. remember that there are three key variables to consider when evaluating call options: strike price, expiration date, and premium.these variables calculate payoffs generated from call options. there are two cases of call option payoffs.
suppose you purchase a call option for company abc for a premium of $2. the option's strike price is $50, and it has an expiration date of nov. 30. you will break even on your investment if abc's stock price reaches $52—meaning the sum of the premium paid plus the stock's purchase price. any increase above that amount is considered a profit. thus, the payoff when abc's share price increases in value is unlimited.
what happens when abc's share price declines below $50 by nov. 30? since your options contract is a right, and not an obligation, to purchase abc shares, you can choose to not exercise it, meaning you will not buy abc's shares. your losses, in this case, will be limited to the premium you paid for the option.
using the formula above, your profit is $3 if abc'sspot priceis $55 on nov. 30.
the payoff calculations for the seller for a call option are not very different. if you sell an abc options contract with the same strike price and expiration date, you stand to gain only if the price declines. depending on whether your call is covered ornaked, your losses could be limited or unlimited. the latter case occurs when you are forced to purchase the underlying stock at spot prices (or, perhaps, even more) if the options buyer exercises the contract. your sole source of income (and profits) in this case is limited to the premium you collect on expiration of the options contract.
the formulas for calculating payoffs and profits are as follows:
using the formula above, your income is $1 if abc's spot price is $47 on nov. 30.
there are several factors to keep in mind when it comes toselling call options. be sure you fully understand an option contract's value and profitability when considering a trade, or else you risk the stock rallying too high.
call options often serve three primary purposes: income generation, speculation, and tax management.
some investors use call options to generate income through acovered callstrategy. this strategy involves owning an underlying stock while at the same timewritinga call option, or giving someone else the right to buy your stock. the investor collects the option premium and hopes the option expires worthless (below strike price). this strategy generates additional income for the investor but can also limit profit potential if the underlying stock price rises sharply.
covered calls work because if the stock rises above the strike price, the option buyer will exercise their right to buy the stock at the lower strike price. this means the option writer doesn't profit from the stock's movement above the strike price. the options writer's maximum profiton the optionis the premium received.
options contracts give buyers the opportunity to obtain significant exposure to a stock for a relatively small price. used in isolation, they can provide significant gains if a stock rises. but they can also result in a 100% loss of the premium if the call option expires worthless due to the underlying stock price failing to move above the strike price. the benefit of buying call options is that risk is always capped at the premium paid for the option.
investors may also buy and sell different call options simultaneously, creating a callspread. these will cap both the potential profit and loss from the strategy but are more cost-effective in some cases than a single call option because the premium collected from one option's sale offsets the premium paid for the other.
investors sometimes use options to changeportfolioallocations without actually buying or selling the underlying security.
for example, an investor may own 100 shares of xyz stock and may be liable for a large unrealizedcapital gain. not wanting to trigger ataxable event, shareholders may use options to reduce the exposure to the underlying security without actually selling it.in the case above, the only cost to the shareholder for engaging in this strategy is the cost of the options contract itself.
though options profits will be classified as short-term capital gains, the method for calculating the tax liability will vary by the exact option strategy and holding period.

suppose that microsoft stock is trading at $108 per share. you own 100 shares of the stock and want to generate an income above and beyond the stock's dividend. you also believe that shares are unlikely to rise above $115 per share over the next month.
you take a look at the call options for the following month and see that there's a 115 call trading at 37 cents per contract. so, you sell one call option and collect the $37 premium (37 cents x 100 shares), representing a roughly 4% annualized income.
if the stock rises above $115, the option buyer will exercise the option, and you will have to deliver the 100 shares of stock at $115 per share. you still generated a profit of $7 per share, but you will have missed out on any upside above $115. if the stock doesn't rise above $115, you keep the shares and the $37 in premium income.
call options are a type of derivative contract that gives the holder the right but not the obligation to purchase a specified number of shares at a predetermined price, known as the ""strike price"" of the option. if the market price of the stock rises above the option's strike price, the option holder can exercise their option, buying at the strike price and selling at the higher market price in order to lock in a profit. options only last for a limited period of time, however. if the market price does not rise above the strike price during that period, the options expire worthless.
investors will consider buying call options if they are optimistic—or ""bullish""—about the prospects of its underlying shares. for these investors, call options might provide a more attractive way to speculate on the prospects of a company because of the leverage that they provide. after all, each options contract provides the opportunity to buy 100 shares of the company in question. for an investor who is confident that a company's shares will rise, buying shares indirectly through call options can be an attractive way to increase their purchasing power.
buying calls is a bullish, because the buyer only profits if the price of the shares rises. conversely, selling call options is abearishbehavior, because the seller profits if the shares do not rise. whereas the profits of a call buyer are theoretically unlimited, the profits of a call seller are limited to the premium they receive when they sell the calls.
call options are financial contracts that give the option buyer the right but not the obligation to buy a stock, bond, commodity, or other asset or instrument at a specified price within a specific time period. the stock, bond, or commodity is called the underlying asset. options can be speculative instruments that rely onleverage. a call buyer profits when the underlying asset increases in price. a call option seller can generate income by collecting premiums from the sale of options contracts. the tax treatment for call options varies based on the strategy and type of call options that generate profits.

0f755265-7a98-5141-b2f1-5cf5c2d3a27b,Investopedia,Portfolio Management,What Is Diversification? Definition as Investing Strategy,,,Troy SegalGordon ScottAmanda Bellucco-Chatham,"diversification is arisk managementstrategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. a diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt at limiting exposure to any single asset or risk.
the rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security.
studies and mathematical models have shown that maintaining a well-diversified portfolio of 25 to 30 stocks yields the most cost-effective level of risk reduction. the investing in more securities generates further diversification benefits, albeit at a drastically smaller rate.
diversification strives to smooth out unsystematic risk events in a portfolio, so the positive performance of some investments neutralizes thenegative performanceof others. the benefits of diversification hold only if the securities in the portfolio are not perfectlycorrelated—that is, they respond differently, often in opposing ways, to market influences.
as investors consider ways to diversify their holdings, there are dozens of strategies to implement. many of the strategies below can be combined to enhance the level of diversification within a single portfolio.
fund managers and investors often diversify their investments across asset classes and determine what percentages of the portfolio to allocate to each. each asset class has a different, unique set of risks and opportunities. classes can include:
the theory holds that what may negatively impact one asset class may be beneficial to another. for example, rising interest rates usually negatively impacts bond prices as yield must increase to make fixed income securities more attractive. on the other hand, rising interest rates may result in increases in rent for real estate or increases in prices for commodities.
there's tremendous differences in the way different industries or sectors operate. as investors diversify across different industries, they become less likely to be impacted by sector-specific risk.
for example, consider the chips and science act of 2022.this piece of legislation impacts many different industries, though some companies are more impacted than others.semiconductormanufacturers will be largely impacted, while the financial services sector might feel smaller, residual impacts.
investors can diversify across industries by coupling investments that may counterbalance different businesses. for example, consider two major means of entertainment: travel and digital streaming. investors hoping to hedge against the risk of future major pandemic impacts may invest in digital streaming platforms (i.e. positively impacted by shutdowns). at the same time, investors may consider simultaneously investing in airlines (positively impacted by less shutdowns). in theory, these two unrelated industries may minimize overall portfolio risk.
how many stocks do you need to own to be properly diversified? a study published in the journal of risk and financial management found there are simply too many variables to consider and ""an optimal number of stocks that constitute a well-diversified portfolio does not exist"".
public equities tend to be broken into two categories:growth stocksorvalue stocks. growth stocks are stocks in companies that are expected to experience profit or revenue growth greater than the industry average. value stocks are stocks in companies that appear to be trading at a discount based on the current fundamentals of a company.
growth stocks tend to be more risky as the expected growth of a company may not materialize. for example, if the federal reserve constricts monetary policy, less capital is usually available (or it is more expense to borrow money), creating a more difficult scenario for growth companies. however, growth companies may tap into seemingly limitless potential and exceed expectations, generating even greater returns than previously expected.
on the other hand, value stocks tend to be more established, stable companies. while these companies may have already experienced most of their potential, they usually carry less risk. by diversifying into both, an investor would capitalize in the future potential of some companies while also recognizing the existing benefits of others.
investors may want to consider investing across different securities based on the underlyingmarket capitalizationof the asset or company. consider the vast operational differences between apple and embecta corporation. as of august 2022, both companies are in the s&p 500, with apple representing 7.3% of the index and embecta representing .000005%.
each of the two companies will have considerably different approach in raising capital, introducing new products to the market, brand recognition, and growth potential. broadly speaking, lower cap stocks have more room to grow, though higher cap stocks tend to be safer investments.
across almost every asset class, investors can choose the underlying risk profile of the security. for example, consider fixed-income securities. an investor can choose to buy bonds from the top-rated governments in the world or to buy bonds from nearly defunct private companies that are raisingemergency funds. there are considerable differences between several 10-year bonds based on the issuer, their credit rating, their future operational outlook, and their existing level of debt.
the same can be said for other types of investments. real estate development projects with more risk may carry greater upside than established, operating properties. meanwhile, cryptocurrencies with longer histories and greater adoption such as bitcoin carry less risk compared to smaller market cap coins or tokens.
for investors wanting to maximize their returns, diversification may not be the best strategy. consider ""yolo"" (you only live once) strategies where 100% of capital is placed in a high-risk investment. though there is the higher probably of making life-changing money, there is also the highest probability of losing capital due to poor diversification.
specific to fixed-income securities such as bonds, different term lengths impact different risk profiles. in general, the longer thematurity, the higher the risk of fluctuations in the bond's prices due to changes in interest rates. short-term bonds tend to offer lower interest rates; however, they also tend to be less impacted by uncertainty in future yield curves. investors more comfortable with risk may consider adding longer term bonds that tend to pay higher degrees of interest.
maturity length is also prevalent in other assets classes. consider the difference between short-term lease agreements for residential properties (i.e. up to one year) and long-term lease agreements for commercial properties (i.e. sometimes five years or greater). though there is more security in collecting rent revenue by locking into a long-term agreement, investors sacrifice flexibility to increase prices or change tenants.
investors can reap further diversification benefits by investing in foreign securities. for example, forces depressing the u.s. economy may not affect japan's economy in the same way. therefore, holding japanese stocks gives an investor a small cushion of protection against losses during an american economic downturn.
alternatively, there may be greater potential upside (with associated higher degrees of risk) when diversifying across developed and emerging countries. consider pakistan's current classification as afrontier marketparticipant (recently downgraded from an emerging market participant).investor willing to take on higher levels of risk may want to consider the higher growth potential of smaller, yet to be fully established markets such as pakistan.
financial instruments such as stocks and bonds are intangible investments; they can not be physically touched or felt. on the other hand, tangible investments such as land, real estate, farmland, precious metals, or commodities can be touched and have real world applications. thesereal assetshave different investment profiles as they can consumed, rented, developed on, or treated differently than intangible or digital assets.
there are also unique risks specific to tangible assets. real property can be vandalized, physically stolen, damaged by natural conditions, or become obsolete. real assets may also require storage, insurance, or security costs to carry. though the revenue stream is different than financial instruments, the input costs to protect tangible assets is also different.
regardless of how an investor considers building their own platform, another aspect of diversification relates to how those assets are held. though this not an implication of the investment's risk, it is an additional risk worth considering as it may be diversifiable.
for example, consider an individual with $400,000 of u.s. currency. in all three of the situations below, the investor has the same asset allocation. however, their risk profile is different:
the same concept above relates to almost every asset class. for example, celsius network filed for bankruptcy in july 2022.investors holding cryptocurrency with the exchange experienced the inability to withdraw or transfer funds. had investors diversified across platforms, the risk of loss would have been spread across different exchanges.
consider different strategies to offset technology risk and physical risk. for example, owning both physical gold bars and gold etfs diversifies your portfolio across various risks. if your physical holdings were to be stolen, at least 100% of your gold ownership was not lost.
time and budget constraints can make it difficult for noninstitutional investors—i.e., individuals—to create an adequately diversified portfolio. this challenge is a key reason whymutual fundsare so popular with retail investors. buying shares in a mutual fund offers an inexpensive way to diversify investments.
while mutual funds provide diversification across various asset classes, exchange-traded funds (etfs) afford investor access to narrow markets such as commodities and international plays that would ordinarily be difficult to access. an individual with a $100,000 portfolio can spread the investment among etfs with no overlap.
there's several reasons why this is advantageous to investors. first, it may be costly to individually buy securities using different market orders. in addition, investors must then track their portfolio's weight to ensure proper diversification. though an investor sacrifices a say in all of the underlying companies being invested in, they simply choose an easier investment approach that prioritizes minimizing risk.
the primary purpose of diversification is to mitigate risk. by spreading your investment across different asset classes, industries, or maturities, you are less likely to experience market shocks that impact every single one of your investments the same.
there are other benefits to had as well. some investors may find diversification makes investing more fun as it encourages exploring different unique investments. diversification may also increase the chance of hitting positive news. instead of hoping for favorable news specific to one company, positive news impacting one of dozens of companies may be beneficial to your portfolio.
however, there are drawbacks to diversification, too. the more holdings a portfolio has, the more time-consuming it can be to manage—and the more expensive, since buying and selling many different holdings incurs more transaction fees and brokerage commissions. more fundamentally, diversification's spreading-out strategy works both ways, lessening both the risk and the reward.
say you've invested $120,000 equally among six stocks, and one stock doubles in value. your original $20,000 stake is now worth $40,000. you've made a lot, sure, but not as much as if your entire $120,000 had been invested in that one company. by protecting you on the downside, diversification limits you on the upside—at least, in the short term. over the long term, diversified portfolios do tend to post higher returns (see example below).
reduces portfolio risk
hedges against market volatility
offers potentially higher returns long-term
may be more enjoyable for investors to research new investments
limits gains short-term
time-consuming to manage
incurs more transaction fees, commissions
may be overwhelming for newer, unexperienced investors
the idea behind diversification is to minimize (or even eliminate) risk within a portfolio. however, there are certain types of risks you can diversify away, and there are certain types of risks that exist regardless of how you diversify. these types of risks are calledunsystematic riskandsystematic risk.
consider the impact of covid-19. due to the global health crisis, many businesses stopped operating. employees across many different industries were laid off, and consumer spending across all sectors was at risk of declining. on one hand, almost every sector was negatively impacted by economic slowdown. on the other hand, almost every sector then benefited from government intervention and monetary stimulus. the impact of covid-19 on financial markets was systematic.
in general, diversification aims to reduce unsystematic risk. these are the risks specific to an investment that are unique to that holding. examples of diversifiable, non-systematic risks include:
through diversification, investors strive to reduce the risks above which are controllable based on the investments held.
it can become complex and cumbersome to measure how diversified a portfolio is. in reality, it is impossible to calculate the actual degree of diversification; there are simply too many variables to consider across too many assets to truly quantify a single measure of diversification. still, analysts and portfolio managers use several measurements to get a rough idea of how diversified a portfolio is.
acorrelation coefficientis a statistical measurement that compares the relationship between two variables. this statistical calculation tracks the movement of two assets and whether the assets tend to move in the same direction. the correlation coefficient result varies from -1 to 1, with interpretations ranging from:
standard deviationis used to measure how likely an outcome will occur away from the mean. for example, imagine two investments, each with an average annual return of 5%. one has a high standard deviation, which means the investment has a higher chance or returning 20% or -20%. the other investment has a low standard deviation, which means the investment has a higher chance of returning 6% or 4% (returns closer to the mean).
analyzing standard deviations is one method of tracking diversification to understand the risk profiles across assets. a portfolio full of high standard deviations may have higher earning potential; however, these assets may be more likely to experience similar risks across asset classes.
smart beta strategiesoffer diversification by tracking underlying indices but do not necessarily weigh stocks according to their market cap. etf managers further screen equity issues on fundamentals and rebalance portfolios according to objective analysis and not just company size. while smart beta portfolios are unmanaged, the primary goal becomes outperformance of the index itself.
in its most basic form, a portfolio's diversification can be measured by counting the number of assets or determining the weight of each asset. when counting the number of assets, consider the number of each type for the strategies above. for example, an investor can count that of the 20 equities they hold, 15 are in the technology sector.
alternatively, investors can measure diversification by allocating percentages to what they are invested in. in the example directly above, the investor has 75% of their equity holdings in a single industry. on a broader portfolio basis, investors more often compare equity, bonds, and alternative assets to create their diversification targets. for example, traditional portfolios tended to skew towards 60% equities, 40% bonds—though some strategies call for different diversification based on age. now, more modern theories claim there are added benefits in holding alternative assets (for example, 60% equities, 20% bonds, and 20% alternatives).
say anaggressive investorwho can assume a higher level of risk, wishes to construct a portfolio composed of japanese equities, australian bonds, and cotton futures. he can purchase stakes in the ishares msci japan etf, the vanguard australian government bond index etf, and the ipath bloomberg cotton subindex total return etn, for example.
with this mix of etf shares, due to the specific qualities of the targeted asset classes and the transparency of the holdings, the investor ensures true diversification in their holdings. also, with different correlations, or responses to outside forces, among the securities, they can slightly lessen their risk exposure.
in theory, holding investments that are different from each other reduces the overall risk of the assets you're invested in. if something bad happens to one investment, you're more likely to have assets that are not impacted if you were diversified.
diversification may result in larger profit if you are extended into asset classes you wouldn't otherwise have invested in. also, some investors find diversification more enjoyable to pursue as they get to research new companies, explore different asset classes, and own different types of investments.
there's many different ways to diversify; the primary method of diversification is to buy different types of asset classes. for example, instead of putting your entire portfolio into public stock, you may consider buying some bonds to offset some market risk of stocks.
in addition to investing in different asset classes, you can diversify into different industries, geographical locations, term lengths, or market caps. the primary goal of diversification is to invest in a broad range of assets that face different risks.
for investors seeking to minimize risk, diversification is a strong strategy. that said, diversification may minimize returns as the goal of diversification is to reduce the risk within a portfolio. by reducing risk, an investor is willing to take less profit in exchange for the preservation of capital.
buying an index fund or etf of the s&p 500 is an example of diversification. the fund will hold an ownership stake in many different companies across different sectors and product lines. these companies may also operate out of different markets around the world.
diversification is a very important concept in financial planning and investment management. it is the idea that by investing in different things, the overall risk of your portfolio is lower. instead of putting all of your money into a single asset, spreading your wealth across different assets puts you at less risk of losing capital. with the ease of transacting and investing online, it is now incredibly easy to diversify your portfolio through different asset classes and other strategies.

fa36d0f0-e7cc-5b18-ac2f-4a95464bd7a3,Investopedia,Corporate Finance,"Cash Flow: What It Is, How It Works, and How To Analyze It",,,Adam HayesAmy DruryMelody Kazel,"the term cash flow refers to the net amount of cash and cash equivalents being transferred in and out of a company. cash received represents inflows, while money spent represents outflows.
a company’s ability to create value forshareholdersis fundamentally determined by its ability to generate positive cash flows or, more specifically, to maximize long-termfree cash flow(cfc). fcf is the cash generated by a company from its normal business operations after subtracting any money spent oncapital expenditures(capex).
cash flow is the amount of cash that comes in and goes out of a company. businesses take in money from sales asrevenuesand spend money on expenses. they may also receive income from interest, investments,royalties, and licensing agreements and sell products on credit, expecting to actually receive the cash owed at a late date.
assessing the amounts, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows, along with where they originate and where they go, is one of the most important objectives of financial reporting. it is essential for assessing a company’sliquidity, flexibility, and overall financial performance.
positive cash flow indicates that acompany's liquid assetsare increasing, enabling it to cover obligations, reinvest in its business, return money to shareholders, pay expenses, and provide a buffer against future financial challenges. companies with strong financial flexibility can take advantage of profitable investments. they also fare better in downturns, by avoiding the costs offinancial distress.
cash flows can be analyzed using thecash flow statement, a standard financial statement that reports on a company's sources and usage of cash over a specified time period. corporate management, analysts, and investors are able to use it to determine how well a company can earn cash to pay its debts and manage its operating expenses. the cash flow statement is one of the most important financial statements issued by a company, along with the balance sheet and income statement.
cash flow can be negative when outflows are higher than a company's inflows.
as noted above, there are three critical parts of a company's financial statements:
but the cash flow does not necessarily show all the company's expenses. that's because not all expenses the company accrues are paid right away. although the company may incurliabilities, any payments toward these liabilities are not recorded as a cash outflow until the transaction occurs.
the first item to note on the cash flow statement is the bottom line item. this is likely to be recorded as the net increase/decrease incash and cash equivalents(cce). the bottom line reports the overall change in the company's cash and its equivalents (the assets that can be immediately converted into cash) over the last period.
if you check undercurrent assetson the balance sheet, that's where you'll find cce. if you take the difference between the current cce and that of the previous year or the previous quarter, you should have the same number as the number at the bottom of the statement of cash flows.
cash flow from operations (cfo), oroperating cash flow, describes money flows involved directly with the production and sale of goods from ordinary operations. cfo indicates whether or not a company has enough funds coming in to pay its bills oroperating expenses. in other words, there must be more operating cash inflows than cash outflows for a company to be financially viable in the long term.
operating cash flow is calculated by taking cash received from sales and subtracting operating expenses that were paid in cash for the period. operating cash flow is recorded on a company's cash flow statement, which is reported both on a quarterly and annual basis. operating cash flow indicates whether a company can generate enough cash flow to maintain and expand operations, but it can also indicate when a company may need externalfinancingfor capital expansion.
note that cfo is useful in segregating sales from cash received. if, for example, a company generated a large sale from a client, it would boost revenue and earnings. however, the additional revenue doesn't necessarily improve cash flow if there is difficulty collecting the payment from the customer.
cash flow from investing (cfi) orinvesting cash flowreports how much cash has been generated or spent from various investment-related activities in a specific period. investing activities include purchases of speculativeassets, investments in securities, or the sale of securities or assets.
negative cash flow from investing activities might be due to significant amounts of cash being invested in the long-term health of the company, such asresearch and development(r&d), and is not always a warning sign.
cash flows from financing (cff), orfinancing cash flow, shows the net flows of cash that are used to fund the company and its capital. financing activities include transactions involving issuing debt, equity, and paying dividends. cash flow from financing activities provide investors with insight into a company’s financial strength and how well a company'scapital structureis managed.
contrary to what you may think, cash flow isn't the same as profit. it isn't uncommon to have these two terms confused because they seem very similar. remember that cash flow is the money that goes in and out of a business.
profit, on the other hand, is specifically used to measure a company's financial success or how much money it makes overall. this is the amount of money that is left after a company pays off all its obligations. profit is whatever is left after subtracting a company's expenses from its revenues.
using the cash flow statement in conjunction with other financial statements can help analysts and investors arrive at various metrics and ratios used to make informed decisions and recommendations.
even profitable companies can fail if their operating activities do not generate enough cash to stay liquid. this can happen if profits are tied up in outstandingaccounts receivable(ar) and overstocked inventory, or if a company spends too much on capital expenditures (capex).
investors and creditors, therefore, want to know if the company has enough cce to settle short-term liabilities. to see if a company can meet its current liabilities with the cash it generates from operations, analysts look at thedebt service coverage ratio(dscr).
but liquidity only tells us so much. a company might have lots of cash because it is mortgaging its future growth potential by selling off its long-term assets or taking on unsustainable levels of debt.
analysts look at free cash flow (fcf) to understand the true profitability of a business. fcf is a really useful measure of financial performance and tells a better story thannet incomebecause it shows what money the company has left over to expand the business or return to shareholders, after payingdividends, buying back stock, or paying off debt.
useunlevered free cash flow(ufcf) for a measure of the gross fcf generated by a firm. this is a company's cash flow excluding interest payments, and it shows how much cash is available to the firm before taking financial obligations into account. thedifference between levered and unleveredfcf shows if the business is overextended or operating with a healthy amount of debt.
below is a reproduction of walmart's cash flow statement for thefiscal yearending on jan. 31, 2019. all amounts are in millions of u.s. dollars.
the final line in the cash flow statement, ""cash and cash equivalents at end of year,"" is the same as ""cash and cash equivalents,"" the first line under current assets in the balance sheet. the first number in the cash flow statement, ""consolidated net income,"" is the same as the bottom line, ""income from continuing operations"" on the income statement.
because the cash flow statement only counts liquid assets in the form of cce, it makes adjustments to operating income in order to arrive at the net change in cash.depreciationandamortizationexpense appear on the income statement in order to give a realistic picture of the decreasing value of assets over their useful life. operating cash flows, however, only consider transactions that impact cash, so these adjustments are reversed.
the net change in assets not in cash, such as ar and inventories, are also eliminated from operating income. for example, $368 million innet receivablesare deducted from operating income. from that, we can infer that there was a $368 million increase in receivables over the prior year.
this increase would have shown up in operating income as additional revenue, but the cash wasn't received yet by year-end. thus, the increase in receivables needed to be reversed out to show the net cash impact of sales during the year. the same elimination occurs for current liabilities in order to arrive at the cash flow from operating activities figure.
investments inproperty, plant, and equipment(pp&e) and acquisitions of other businesses are accounted for in the cash flow from the investing activities section. proceeds from issuing long-term debt, debt repayments, and dividends paid out are accounted for in the cash flow from financing activities section.
the main takeaway is that walmart's cash flow was positive (an increase of $742 million). that indicates that it has retained cash in the business and added to its reserves in order to handle short-term liabilities and fluctuations in the future.
revenues refer to the income earned from selling goods and services. if an item is sold on credit or via a subscription payment plan, money may not yet be received from those sales and are booked as accounts receivable. but these do not represent actual cash flows into the company at the time. cash flows also track outflows as well as inflows and categorize them with regard to the source or use.
the three types of cash flows are operating cash flows, cash flows from investments, and cash flows from financing.
operating cash flows are generated from the normal operations of a business, including money taken in from sales and money spent oncost of goods sold(cogs), along with other operational expenses such as overhead and salaries.
cash flows from investments include money spent on purchasingsecuritiesto be held as investments such as stocks or bonds in other companies or in treasuries. inflows are generated by interest and dividends paid on these holdings.
cash flows from financing are the costs of raising capital, such as shares or bonds that a company issues or any loans it takes out.
free cash flow is the cash left over after a company pays for its operating expenses and capex. it is the money that remains after paying for items like payroll, rent, and taxes. companies are free to use fcf as they please.
knowing how to calculate fcf and analyze it helps a company with itscash managementand will provide investors with insight into a company's financials, helping them make better investment decisions.
fcf is an important measurement since it shows how efficient a company is at generating cash.
the cash flow statement complements the balance sheet and income statement and is a mandatory part of a public company's financial reporting requirements since 1987.
theprice-to-cash flow(p/cf) ratio is a stock multiple that measures the value of a stock’s price relative to its operating cash flow per share. this ratio uses operating cash flow, which adds back non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization to net income.
p/cf is especially useful for valuing stocks that have positive cash flow but are not profitable because of largenon-cash charges.
cash flow refers to money that goes in and out. having a positive cash flow means there's more money coming in while a negative cash flow indicates a higher degree of spending. the latter isn't necessarily a bad thing because it may mean that you're investing your money in growth. but if your spending becomes excessive, you won't have enough for a rainy day and you won't be able to pay your suppliers or lenders. whether you're running a business or a household, it's important to keep on top of your cash flow.

b5d34b18-ad7f-592b-bd01-0848376e397a,Investopedia,Investing,Bond: Financial Meaning With Examples and How They Are Priced,,,Jason FernandoAnthony BattleKatharine Beer,"a bond is afixed-income instrumentthat represents a loan made by an investor to a borrower (typically corporate or governmental). a bond could be thought of as ani.o.u.between thelenderand borrower that includes the details of the loan and its payments. bonds are used by companies, municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. owners of bonds are debtholders, or creditors, of the issuer.
bond details include the end date when theprincipalof the loan is due to be paid to the bond owner and usually include the terms forvariableorfixed interestpayments made by the borrower.
bonds are debt instruments and represent loans made to the issuer. governments (at all levels) and corporations commonly use bonds in order to borrow money. governments need to fund roads, schools, dams, or other infrastructure. the sudden expense of war may also demand the need to raise funds.
similarly, corporations will often borrow togrow their business, to buy property and equipment, to undertake profitable projects, for research and development, or to hire employees. the problem that large organizations run into is that they typically need far more money than the average bank can provide.
bonds provide a solution by allowing many individual investors to assume the role of the lender. indeed, public debt markets let thousands of investors each lend a portion of the capital needed. moreover, markets allow lenders to sell their bonds to other investors or tobuy bondsfrom other individuals—long after the original issuing organization raised capital.
bonds are commonly referred to as fixed-income securities and are one of the mainasset classesthat individual investors are usually familiar with, along with stocks (equities) and cash equivalents.
when companies or other entities need to raise money to finance new projects, maintain ongoing operations, or refinance existing debts, they may issue bonds directly to investors. the borrower (issuer) issues a bond that includes the terms of the loan, interest payments that will be made, and the time at which the loaned funds (bond principal) must be paid back (maturity date). the interest payment (the coupon) is part of the return that bondholders earn for loaning their funds to the issuer. the interest rate that determines the payment is called thecoupon rate.
the initial price of most bonds is typically set atat par, or $1,000face valueper individual bond. the actual market price of a bond depends on a number of factors: thecredit qualityof the issuer, the length of time until expiration, and the coupon rate compared to the general interest rate environment at the time. the face value of the bond is what will be paid back to the borrower once the bond matures.
most bonds can be sold by the initial bondholder to other investors after they have been issued. in other words, a bond investor does not have to hold a bondall the way through to its maturity date. it is also common for bonds to be repurchased by the borrower if interest rates decline, or if the borrower’s credit has improved, and it can reissue new bonds at a lower cost.

many corporate andgovernment bondsare publicly traded; others are traded onlyover-the-counter(otc) or privately between the borrower and lender.
most bonds share some common basic characteristics including:
two features of a bond—credit qualityand time to maturity—are the principal determinants of a bond's coupon rate. if the issuer has a poorcredit rating, theriskofdefaultis greater, and these bonds pay more interest. bonds that have a very long maturity date also usually pay a higher interest rate. this higher compensation is because the bondholder is more exposed tointerest rateand inflation risks for an extended period.
credit ratings for a company and its bonds are generated by credit rating agencies likestandard and poor’s,moody’s, andfitch ratings. the very highest quality bonds are called “investment grade” and include debt issued by the u.s. government and very stable companies, such as many utilities.
bonds that are not considered investment grade but are not in default are called “high yield” or “junk” bonds. these bonds have a higher risk of default in the future and investors demand a higher coupon payment to compensate them for that risk.
bonds and bond portfolios will rise or fall in value as interest rates change. the sensitivity to changes in the interest rate environment is called “duration.” the use of the term duration in this context can be confusing to new bond investors because it does not refer to the length of time the bond has before maturity. instead, duration describes how much a bond’s price will rise or fall with a change in interest rates.
the rate of change of a bond’s or bond portfolio’s sensitivity to interest rates (duration) is called “convexity.” these factors are difficult to calculate, and the analysis required is usually done by professionals.
there are four primary categories of bonds sold in the markets. however, you may also seeforeign bondsissued by global corporations and governments on some platforms.
the bonds available for investors come in many different varieties. they can be separated by the rate or type of interest or coupon payment, by being recalled by the issuer, or because they have other attributes. below, we list some of the most common variations:
zero-coupon bonds(z-bonds) do not pay coupon payments and instead are issued at a discount to their par value that will generate a return once the bondholder is paid the full face value when the bond matures. u.s. treasury bills are a zero-coupon bond.
convertible bondsare debt instruments with an embedded option that allows bondholders to convert their debt into stock (equity) at some point, depending on certain conditions like the share price.for example, imagine a company that needs to borrow $1 million to fund a new project. they could borrow by issuing bonds with a 12% coupon that matures in 10 years. however, if they knew that there were some investors willing to buy bonds with an 8% coupon that allowed them to convert the bond into stock if the stock’s price rose above a certain value, they might prefer to issue those.
the convertible bond may be the best solution for the company because they would have lower interest payments while the project was in its early stages. if the investors converted their bonds, the other shareholders would be diluted, but the company would not have to pay any more interest or the principal of the bond.
the investors who purchased a convertible bond may think this is a great solution because they can profit from the upside in the stock if the project is successful. they are taking more risk by accepting a lower coupon payment, but the potential reward if the bonds are converted could make that trade-off acceptable.
callable bondsalso have an embedded option, but it is different than what is found in a convertible bond. a callable bond is one that can be “called” back by the company before it matures.assume that a company has borrowed $1 million by issuing bonds with a 10% coupon that mature in 10 years. if interest rates decline (or the company’s credit rating improves) in year five when the company could borrow for 8%, they will call or buy the bonds back from the bondholders for the principal amount and reissue new bonds at a lower coupon rate.
a callable bond is riskier for the bond buyer because the bond is more likely to be called when it is rising in value. remember, when interest rates are falling, bond prices rise. because of this, callable bonds are not as valuable as bonds that aren’t callable with the same maturity, credit rating, and coupon rate.
aputtable bondallows the bondholders to put or sell the bond back to the company before it has matured. this is valuable for investors who are worried that a bond may fall in value, or if they think interest rates will rise and they want to get their principal back before the bond falls in value.
the bond issuer may include a put option in the bond that benefits the bondholders in return for a lower coupon rate or just to induce the bond sellers to make the initial loan. a puttable bond usually trades at a higher value than a bond without a put option but with the same credit rating, maturity, and coupon rate because it is more valuable to the bondholders.
the possible combinations of embedded puts, calls, and convertibility rights in a bond are endless and each one is unique. there isn’t a strict standard for each of these rights and some bonds will contain more than one kind of “option,” which can make comparisons difficult. generally, individual investors rely on bond professionals to select individual bonds or bond funds that meet their investing goals.
the market prices bonds based on their particular characteristics. a bond's price changes on a daily basis, just like that of any other publicly traded security, wheresupply and demandat any given moment determine that observed price.
but there is a logic to how bonds are valued. up to this point, we've talked about bonds as if every investor holds them tomaturity. it's true that if you do this you're guaranteed to get yourprincipalback plus interest; however, a bond does not have to be held to maturity. at any time, a bondholder can sell their bonds in the open market, where the price can fluctuate, sometimes dramatically.
the price of a bond changes in response to changes in interest rates in the economy. this is due to the fact that for afixed-rate bond, the issuer has promised to pay a coupon based on theface valueof the bond—so for a $1,000 par, 10% annual coupon bond, the issuer will pay the bondholder $100 each year.
say that prevailing interest rates are also 10% at the time that this bond is issued, as determined by the rate on a short-term government bond. an investor would be indifferent to investing in the corporate bond or the government bond, since both would return $100. however, imagine a little while later, that the economy has taken a turn for the worse and interest rates dropped to 5%. now, the investor can only receive $50 from the government bond but would still receive $100 from the corporate bond.
this difference makes the corporate bond much more attractive. so investors in the market will bid up to the price of the bond until it trades at a premium that equalizes the prevailing interest rate environment—in this case, the bond will trade at a price of $2,000 so that the $100 coupon represents 5%. likewise, if interest rates soared to 15%, then an investor could make $150 from the government bond and would not pay $1,000 to earn just $100. this bond would be sold until it reached a price that equalized the yields, in this case to a price of $666.67.
this is why the famous statement that a bond’s price varies inversely with interest rates works. when interest rates go up, bond prices fall in order to have the effect of equalizing the interest rate on the bond with prevailing rates, and vice versa.
another way of illustrating this concept is to consider what the yield on our bond would be given a price change, instead of given an interest rate change. for example, if the price were to go down from $1,000 to $800, then the yield goes up to 12.5%.
this happens because you are getting the same guaranteed $100 on an asset that is worth $800 ($100/$800). conversely, if the bond goes up in price to $1,200, the yield shrinks to 8.33% ($100/$1,200).
bond prices in the market react inversely to changes in interest rates.
theyield-to-maturity(ytm) of a bond is another way of considering a bond’s price. ytm is the totalreturnanticipated on a bond if the bond is held until the end of its lifetime. yield to maturity is considered along-termbond yieldbut is expressed as anannualrate. in other words, it is theinternal rate of returnof an investment in a bond if the investor holds the bond until maturity and if all payments are made as scheduled.
ytm is a complex calculation but is quite useful as a concept for evaluating the attractiveness of one bond relative to other bonds of different coupons and maturity in the market. the formula for ytm involves solving for the interest rate in the following equation, which is no easy task, and therefore most bond investors interested in ytm will use a computer:
ytm=face valuepresent valuen−1\begin{aligned} &\text{ytm} = \sqrt[n] { \frac { \text{face value} }{ \text{present value} } } - 1 \\ \end{aligned}​ytm=npresent valueface value​​−1​
we can also measure the anticipated changes in bond prices given a change in interest rates with a measure known as thedurationof a bond. duration is expressed in units of the number of years since it originally referred to zero-coupon bonds, whose durationisits maturity.
for practical purposes, however, duration represents the price change in a bond given a 1% change in interest rates. we call this second, more practical definition themodified durationof a bond.
the duration can be calculated to determine the price sensitivity to interest rate changes of a single bond, or for a portfolio of many bonds. in general, bonds with long maturities, and also bonds with low coupons have the greatest sensitivity to interest rate changes. a bond’s duration is not a linear risk measure, meaning that as prices and rates change, the duration itself changes, andconvexitymeasures this relationship.
a bond represents a promise by a borrower to pay a lender their principal and usually interest on a loan. bonds are issued by governments, municipalities, and corporations. the interest rate (coupon rate), principal amount, and maturities will vary from one bond to the next in order to meet the goals of the bond issuer (borrower) and the bond buyer (lender). most bonds issued by companies include options that can increase or decrease their value and can make comparisons difficult for non-professionals. bonds can be bought or sold before they mature, and many are publicly listed and can be traded with a broker.
while governments issue many bonds, corporate bonds can be purchased from brokerages. if you're interested in this investment, you'll need to pick a broker. you can take a look at investopedia's list of thebest online stock brokersto get an idea of which brokers would best suit your needs.
because fixed-rate coupon bonds will pay the same percentage of their face value over time, the market price of the bond will fluctuate as that coupon becomes more or less attractive compared to the prevailing interest rates.
imagine a bond that was issued with a coupon rate of 5% and a $1,000 par value. the bondholder will be paid $50 in interest income annually (most bond coupons are split in half and paid semiannually). as long as nothing else changes in the interest rate environment, the price of the bond should remain at its par value.
however, if interest rates begin to decline and similar bonds are now issued with a 4% coupon, the original bond has become more valuable. investors who want a higher coupon rate will have to pay extra for the bond in order to entice the original owner to sell. the increased price will bring the bond’s total yield down to 4% for new investors because they will have to pay an amount above par value to purchase the bond.
on the other hand, if interest rates rise and the coupon rate for bonds like this one rises to 6%, the 5% coupon is no longer attractive. the bond’s price will decrease and begin selling at a discount compared to the par value until its effective return is 6%.
bonds are a type of security sold by governments and corporations, as a way of raising money from investors. from the seller’s perspective, selling bonds is therefore a way of borrowing money. from the buyer’s perspective, buying bonds is a form of investment because it entitles the purchaser to guaranteed repayment of principal as well as a stream of interest payments. some types of bonds also offer other benefits, such as the ability to convert the bond into shares in the issuing company’s stock.
the bond market tends to move inversely with interest rates because bonds will trade at a discount when interest rates are rising and at a premium when interest rates are falling.
to illustrate, consider the case of xyz corporation. xyz wishes to borrow $1 million to finance the construction of a new factory but is unable to obtain this financing from a bank. instead, xyz decides to raise the money by selling $1 million worth of bonds to investors. under the terms of the bond, xyz promises to pay its bondholders 5% interest per year for five years, with interest paid semiannually. each of the bonds has a face value of $1,000, meaning xyz is selling a total of 1,000 bonds.
the example above is for a typical bond, but there are many special types of bonds available.for example, zero-coupon bonds do not pay interest payments during the term of the bond. instead, their par value—the amount they pay back to the investor at the end of the term—is greater than the amount paid by the investor when they purchased the bond.
convertible bonds, on the other hand, give the bondholder the right to exchange their bond for shares of the issuing company, if certain targets are reached.many other types of bonds exist, offering features related to tax planning, inflation hedging, and others.
bonds tend to be less volatile than stocks, and are typically recommended to make up at least some portion of a diversified portfolio. because bond prices vary inversely with interest rates, they tend to rise in value when rates are falling. if bonds are held to maturity, they will return the entire amount of principal at the end, along with the interest payments made along the way. because of this, bonds are often good for investors who are seeking income and who want to preserve capital. in general, experts advise that as individuals get older or approach retirement, they should shift their portfolio weights more towards bonds.
while there are some specialized bond brokers, today most online and discount brokers offer access to bond markets, and you can buy them more or less like you would with stocks. treasury bonds and tips are typically sold directly via the federal government, and can be purchased via itstreasurydirectwebsite. you can also buy bonds indirectly via fixed-income etfs or mutual funds that invest in a portfolio of bonds.
